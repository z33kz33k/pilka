                    "description": "Wembley Stadium - stadium description\nYou can find out more about the historic Wembley Stadium on a separate webpage\nThe first Wembley Stadium was built between 1922 and 1923, and in just 300 days one of the largest stadiums in the world at the time was built, although interestingly it was initially thought of only as a temporary facility. The stadium was built at a cost of £750,000, using 25,000 tonnes of concrete, 1,500 tonnes of steel and half a million rivets.\nIt was inaugurated on April 28, 1923, on the occasion of the FA Cup final (Bolton Wanderers - West Ham United 2:0). Interest in the match exceeded all expectations. Exact attendance figures are not available, the official figure is 126,047 spectators, but it was probably much higher, with speculation ranging from 150,000 to even 300,000 attendees. If the actual number of spectators was close to the upper limit of estimates, this would represent an unprecedented world record.\nThe venue was built for the British Empire Exhibition (hence its initial name British Empire Exhibition Stadium or simply Empire Stadium). The exhibition was held in 1924 and 1925, and the stadium was scheduled to be demolished afterwards, along with other post-exhibition facilities. However, the stadium managed to be preserved, and over the following years it gained a reputation as one of the most distinctive and recognisable sports venues in the world.\nDesigned by John William Simpson and Maxwell Ayrton and built by Sir Robert McAlpine, the stadium could officially hold 125,000 spectators (including 30,000 seats). The monumental building combined features of ancient Roman and Great Mogul Empire (northern India) architecture. Its distinctive feature was the two 38 m (126 ft) high white towers located on the sides of the main stand facade.\nThe stadium had a running track around the pitch, from 1955 it was equipped with floodlights, and from 1963 the auditorium was fully covered by a roof, supported by internal supports, limiting visibility for some fans. The final capacity of the arena, after the installation of seats in all stands in 1996, was 76,000 spectators.\nCalled the home of English football, it was the venue for regular appearances by the England national football team and hosted the FA Cup finals every year. It was the main arena for the 1948 Olympic Games, hosted some matches (including the final) of the 1966 World Cup and 1996 European Championships, and played host to European club finals, major rugby matches and competitions in many other sports, as well as concerts by world music stars. Greyhound racing and speedway competitions held at Wembley have been very popular.\nTowards the end of the 20th century, discussions began to take place about building a new national stadium for the new century to replace the distinguished Wembley. The possibility of a stadium in Manchester was also considered, but in December 1996 it was finally decided that the new venue would be built on the site of the old Wembley, which was to be demolished.\nThe project to build a new national stadium was initiated by Sport England (then the Sports Council for Great Britain), the body that distributes funds for the development of sports infrastructure from The National Lottery. In late 1998 and early 1999, this entity allocated £120 million to the task.\nThe beneficiary of the grant was the Football Association (FA), the English football association, which set up Wembley National Stadium Ltd. (WNSL). This company was to manage the investment and, in the future, the management of the completed facility.\nIn 1999, WNSL bought the stadium from the existing owner (Wembley plc) for £103m (plus an additional £3m of administration costs). The deal was funded by money from The National Lottery, with the rest of the donation going towards the architectural design work.\nThe design of the new stadium was carried out by Foster + Partners and HOK Sports (later known as Populous), working with designers from Mott Stadium Consortium. The design was presented in 1999. On September 11, 2000, a construction deal was signed with the stadium's main contractor, Multiplex. The selection of the main contractor was made with a lack of adherence to best practice and tendering procedures, which later raised questions about the legitimacy of subsidising the project with public money.\nOn October 7, 2000, the last match was played at the old Wembley. The farewell to the venue did not go very well, as the England national team lost 0:1 to Germany in a World Cup qualifying match.\nAccording to the agreement with the main contractor, the cost of building the stadium was to be £445 million. This was to be a fixed price, no longer subject to later changes. In addition, a figure of £21m was also reckoned for infrastructure development. The costs incurred for the purchase of the old stadium amounted to £106m. Project management costs were to be £86 million, financing costs £79 million and £20 million was set aside for contingencies, total: £757 million.\nThe FA struggled to meet the budget and requested additional public funding, which delayed the project. Grants were eventually secured from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the London Development Agency.\nThe budget was as follows: more than half of the amount needed ( £426 million) was obtained through a loan from Westdeutsche Landesbank, a loan for £7 million was also provided by Credit Suisse First Boston, a total of £161 million was obtained from public funding (£120 million from The National Lottery, £21 million from the London Development Agency and £20 million from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport), and the FA's own contribution was £148 million and £15 million directly from WNSL.\nTowards the end of construction, WNSL agreed to pay additional funds to the main contractor and the total cost of completion rose to £798 million. At the time of opening, the new Wembley was the most expensive stadium in the world.\nThe main contractor was Multiplex from Australia. Project management was handled by Symonds (at the planning stage this function was carried out by McBains Limited - later renamed Tropus Limited). The steel elements were the responsibility of Cleveland Bridge, which was replaced by Hollandia in the summer of 2004. The demolition of the old Wembley was carried out by Griffiths McGee.\nMany other parties and subcontractors were involved in the project, enough to say that residents from every county in England had a hand in creating the steel arch towering over the stadium.\nDemolition did not begin until September 30, 2002 and was completed in 2003, at which point construction of the new arena began. 4,000 piles were driven under the stadium's foundations. Ninety thousand cubic metres of concrete and 23,000 tonnes of steel were used to build the facility. The pitch was lowered by 4 m compared to the previous stadium.\nAt the start of construction, the opening date was set for May 2006, so that the facility would be ready for the FA Cup final. By early 2006, however, it became clear that the delays were too great to complete the work in time. In the end, construction took almost a year longer than expected and the stadium was handed over to the English federation on March 9, 2007.\nThe construction of the new Wembley was not free of problems. In the summer of 2004, the company responsible for the steel elements, Cleveland Bridge, withdrew from the project. It was replaced by the Hollandia company. On March 20, 2006, a roof component slipped, causing the evacuation of more than 3,000 workers from the site. At the same time, damage to sewer pipes requiring repair was also discovered.\nThe most serious incident occurred on January 15, 2004, when 54-year-old Irishman Patrick O'Sullivan was crushed by a falling platform and died at the site. Another worker was also seriously injured in the same accident. The company where O'Sullivan was employed, PC Harrington Ltd, was fined £150,000 for failing to comply with safety rules. On 12 October 2007, a memorial plaque was unveiled at the stadium in memory of the deceased employee.\nThe main contractor, Multiplex, ended the investment with a financial loss estimated at around £150m. Blame was placed on mistakes and misunderstandings with collaborating companies, leading to high-profile court cases against Cleveland Bridge and Mott MacDonald.\nHowever, the FA can count the project as a success. As well as meeting the overarching objective of creating a modern, representative stadium that can host national team matches, FA Cup finals and other events in the right conditions, the investment has proved to be profitable, enabling the loans taken out for the construction to be repaid. A large proportion of the stadium's income comes from profits from the sale of business seats.\nThe opening of the new Wembley was to be sealed with the FA Cup final. At least two events were required beforehand in order to obtain the safety certificate to host it, so two smaller ones were held at the stadium as recently as March 2007: On March 17, the venue was opened to the local residents and members of the England national team supporters' club for tours, and on March 24, an England v Italy under-21 national team match (3:3) was held.\nOn May 19, 2007, the first FA Cup final was played at the new Wembley, with packed stands. The trophy was won by Chelsea FC, after a 1:0 win over Manchester United. The only goal was scored at the end of extra time by Didier Drogba. During the construction period, the FA Cup finals were played at Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.\nOn June 1, 2007, the England national team returned to Wembley, having played their home matches at various stadiums around England since 2001. England's first opponent at the new stadium was Brazil. The friendly encounter ended in a 1:1 draw.\nWith a capacity of 90,000 spectators, Wembley Stadium is the largest football arena in the UK, and the second largest (after Camp Nou) stadium in Europe. As England's premier FA-owned football venue, it regularly hosts the country's national team matches and FA Cup semi-finals and finals.\nIn addition, Wembley is also home to the Community Shield (the equivalent of the Super Cup matches played in many countries), EFL Cup (League Cup) finals, the FA Trophy (cup competitions for teams in tiers 5-8) and the FA Vase (cup competitions for teams in tiers 9 and 10) and, since 2015, the women's FA Cup finals.\nIt has also become a tradition to hold play-off finals for promotion to a higher division from the Championship, League One, League Two and National League (second, third, fourth and fifth league levels respectively). The Championship play-off finals in particular, which decide who will play in the Premier League next season, attract a lot of attention and enjoy a very high attendance in the stands.\nWembley does not have a club that regularly plays home matches there. However, Tottenham played their matches at Wembley between 2016 and 2019 (in the 2016/17 season only in the European Cups). This was due to the demolition of White Hart Lane and the construction of the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in its place.\nOn May 28, 2011, the Champions League final was played at the new Wembley for the first time, with FC Barcelona beating Manchester United 3:1. It is worth noting that the old Wembley has hosted European Cup finals (the predecessor to the Champions League) five times.\nShortly after the 2011 final, the stadium was granted the right to host another Champions League final in 2013. It was controversial to grant one stadium the right to host two finals of Europe's most important club competition in such a short interval, but this was explained by the desire to celebrate the FA's 150th anniversary, which fell in 2013. In the second final, played on May 25 2013, Bayern Munich defeated Borussia Dortmund 2:1.\nIn September 2019, the stadium was granted the right to host the third Champions League final, which was due to take place in 2023. The date was symbolic as Wembley celebrates its centenary in 2023 (counting from the opening of the old stadium). However, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the organisation of the LM finals was rescheduled and the final at Wembley will take place in 2024.\nLondon hosted the Summer Olympics for the third time in 2012. The previous time, in 1948, Wembley was the main arena for the games; this time the newly built Olympic Stadium was the most important stadium, hosting the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the athletics competitions. Wembley, however, hosted some of the matches (including the finals) of the men's and women's football tournaments.\nPlayed across Europe, Euro 2020 (postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) saw three group stage matches (all involving England), two ⅛ of the final, both semi-finals and the final taking place at Wembley. England and Italy faced each other in the final.\nFor the English, it was the first ever European Championship final. The hosts had hoped to win the title at Wembley, as they had done at the 1966 World Cup, but the trophy went to the Italians, who won after a series of penalty kicks. A scandal erupted around the final after riots broke out before the game and unattended fans without tickets broke into the stadium.\nOn June 1, 2022, Wembley hosted the Finalissima, a match between the winner of the last European Championships (Italy) and the Copa América (Argentina). On July 31, 2022, the venue hosted the final of the women's European Championships, in which the home team won after extra time against Germany 2:1, claiming England's first ever title.\nIn 2013, Wembley was one of the arenas for the Rugby League World Cup. The stadium hosted two semi-finals of the tournament (both of which took place on 23 November). In turn, Wembley hosted two Rugby World Cup group matches in 2015. The venue also hosts the final of the national club rugby league cup competition, the Challenge Cup, every year. Each year Wembley also hosts single matches of the most important American football league, the NFL, played as part of the so-called NFL International Series.\nThe new Wembley was built primarily as a football venue, which is also very well suited to hosting rugby and American football competitions. However, the stadium has a multifunctional character and often hosts other sports as well. Amongst other things, Wembley hosts boxing bouts, including fights with world heavyweight titles at stake, such as the clash between Anthony Joshua and Volodymyr Klychko in 2017, and even motor racing (Race of Champions).\nThe stadium is known as a venue for concerts featuring some of the biggest stars in world music. George Michael, Bon Jovi, Adele, Rihanna, Ed Sheeran, Metallica, U2, Foo Fighters, Eminem, Madonna, Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Spice Girls, Coldplay, Harry Styles, Oasis, AC/DC - these are just a few of the many performers who have performed at Wembley.\nAlthough the FA initially resisted selling the naming rights to the stadium, a sponsorship deal was struck with mobile network operator EE in February 2014, which saw the venue renamed Wembley Stadium connected by EE.\nThe most important change compared to the old Wembley is the absence of a running track around the pitch. The new stadium was built by the football federation, hence it has been given a football layout. The stands of the new arena are steeper and much closer to the playing field, although it is notable that a little more space than the required minimum has been retained between the first rows of spectators and the end lines of the pitch.\nThe stadium has been designed to provide the best possible acoustics and to follow in the tradition of the former Wembley, known for its incredible uproar during England national team matches (the so-called 'Wembley Roar'). However, the atmosphere at the new Wembley is no longer as lively as at the old stadium, partly blamed for this by giving the entire middle tier of the stands to business supporters and failing to create a single sector behind one of the gates for the most ardent fans.\nAlthough the roof of the stadium was fitted with movable sections to help provide suitable conditions for the pitch, the state of the pitch in the first few years after the stadium opened left much to be desired and was a frequent subject of criticism from players and coaches. After a series of frequent replacements of the surface, it was decided in the summer of 2010 to change the type of turf from natural to hybrid.\nThe stadium's auditorium is divided into three tiers. The lower tier has 34,303 seats for spectators, the middle tier has 16,532 and the upper tier holds 39,165 people - a total of 90,000 seats. The stands are equipped with red folding seats. Two wide screens have been installed behind the gates and 'Wembley' lettering has been arranged from the seats, in a similar style to the previous stadium. Care has also been taken to ensure adequate comfort, with each seat offering more legroom than was available in the Royal Box at the old Wembley.\nAs at the old Wembley, the pitch is situated on an east-west axis, with the main stand located on the north side. In the main stand is the royal box, where trophies are traditionally presented to footballers, for example after an FA Cup final. To reach the box, players have to climb 107 steps up the stairs (compared to 39 in the old stadium).\nThe venue has an extensive hospitality offer, offering membership to what is known as Club Wembley, access to the stadium's exclusive restaurants, as well as private boxes overlooking the pitch, which can be used at any time. The entire middle tier of the stands are seats available exclusively for the premium offer. The stadium also has 310 wheelchair spaces and 400 seats for journalists.\nThe stands of the stadium are fully covered by a canopy, fitted with additional movable sections - over the stands behind the goals and partly over the south stand. However, the roof does not move over the pitch, so the stadium is not fully enclosed. Exposing sections of the roof is intended to improve ventilation and to increase sunlight and control the shade falling on the pitch.\nThe roof has a surface area of 40,000 m², of which 13,722 m² are movable parts. LED floodlights have been installed under the roof. At its highest point, the roof rises 52 m (171 ft) above the turf.\nThe roof has no internal supports, which were present at the old Wembley and obscured some people's view of pitch events. The elimination of the supports was achieved by a giant arch that rises above the stadium and, using cables, carries 100% of the load of the northern - and 60% of the southern - part of the roof.\nJust as the two white towers were a symbol associated with the previous stadium, the huge steel arch has become a feature of the new Wembley. The arch weighs 1,750 tonnes, rises 133m (436ft) above ground level, has a span length of 315m and a diameter of 7.4m (except for the tapered sections at either end).\nInterestingly, the initial plans called for four masts to be erected at the main stand, to which ropes would be attached to support the northern part of the roof. However, the design later evolved and a more spectacular solution was decided in the form of an arch running above the stadium.\nThe arch was set at an inclined position, at an angle of 112°, and its erection was one of the biggest challenges during the construction of the stadium. Prefabricated segments were created in Darlington in the north of England, from where they were transported to London and assembled on site.\nThe arch structure took more than 10 months to put together. This was followed by a lifting operation using rope jacks, which took six weeks, reaching its final position on June 24, 2004. Until the arch was connected to the roof structure, it was supported by temporary ropes. The arch was attached to two bases, for the foundations of which deep piles were set. In 2014, LED lights were installed on the arch, allowing it to be illuminated in many colours and create striking illuminations.\nThe stadium has 34 bars, eight restaurants and 688 smaller food and drink outlets, as well as 47 other retail and service outlets. The venue has 2,618 toilets, more than any other building in the world. Moving around inside is facilitated by 30 lifts and 26 sets of escalators. The English football federation is based indoors at the stadium.\nThe building's façade features a large amount of glazing, and the façade at the main entrance on the north side has been enhanced with multimedia screens. The outer perimeter of the building is 1 km long. The stadium is encircled by a promenade which, apart from the south side, is on an elevated level. A staircase leads up to it from the east, north and north-west sides.\nIn front of the main entrance is a bronze statue of Bobby Moore, captain of the England team that won the country's only ever World Cup in 1966, beating Germany in the memorable final at Wembley. The statue was unveiled on May 11 2007. On August 29 2015, another statue honouring rugby league legends was unveiled beneath the stadium.\nThe widest staircase, on the north side (only built in 2021-2022, replacing the former footbridge that was a remnant of the old stadium) connects the stadium to Olympic Way. The staircase on the north-west side provides direct access to the OVO Arena Wembley. The stadium is located in the borough of Wembley (from which it takes its name, by the way), in the north-west of the London metropolitan area.\nThe area around the stadium is known as Wembley Park. Its centrepiece is the representative Olympic Way avenue, running from the stadium to Wembley Park tube station. Wembley Stadium railway station is also located close to the stadium (south-west of the stadium). There is limited parking in the area, so fans are recommended to use public transport to get to the stadium.\nSince the construction of the new stadium, the whole area around the stadium has also started to transform intensively. In the immediate surroundings, new buildings are being erected, mainly of a residential and commercial nature.\nThe venue offers what is known as the Wembley Stadium Tour, which is a guided tour of the stadium. The experience includes a tour of the boardroom, changing rooms, a walk through the players' tunnel, the stands and the King's box. The stadium is full of memorabilia relating to its history and the events that took place there."

                    "description": "Old Trafford - stadium description\n“It is the most remarkable arena I have ever seen. As a football ground it is unrivalled in the world. It is an honour to Manchester.” is what The Sporting Chronicle wrote about Old Trafford upon opening in February of 1910. Quite a welcome, but the stadium proved worthy of its reputation over the years.\nBefore moving to Old Trafford, the great Man United began as Newton Heath and only earned its current name after the old club dissolved in early 20th century. By 1909, just 7 years into its operation as United, owner of local brewery and chairman of the club, John Henry Davies, pumped £90,000 into construction of a brand new stadium with open-air embankments on three sides and a covered main grandstand in the south.\nOld Trafford's initial form was created by perhaps the greatest name in British football architecture, Archibald Leitch. This famous Scotsman also worked on Hampden Park, Ibrox and White Hart Lane, to name just a few from his impressive portfolio. For United it was relocation from Bank Street (Clayton) to western Manchester for the first time. The opening game was played against Liverpool FC on February 19, 1910. The Red Devils lost 3:4.\nIn 1911 and 1915 the stadium saw its first FA Cup finals and in 1920 it set the attendance record for a league game, when 70,504 people watched the tie against Aston Villa. All-time record for Old Trafford was set on March 25, 1939, when 76,962 people were drawn to the FA Cup semifinal between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town.\nDuring World War II, on March 11, 1941, the field and stands were seriously damaged by Luftwaffe bombing. The team had to use Manchester City's Maine Road between 1946 and 1949. When finally reopened on August 24, 1949, Old Trafford again saw United lose, this time 0:3 to Bolton Wanderers.\nIn the following years roof was erected above remaining sides of the stadium but it included supports within the stands, which obstructed the view to many people. In mid-1960s expansion of the stands began, first replacing the north and east stands. With terracing in front and seating behind it, this was enough to host the World Cup in 1966.\nFor the next 30 years a series of upgrades took place, not all as fortunate as one would expect. In 1970s it became the first stadium to get perimeter fencing to protect from crowd invasion, the kind of protection that was later removed from all British stadia. Throughout the 70s and 80s the stadium held under 60,000 people but following the Hillsborough disaster and conversion to all-seater mode, it fell to just 44,000. With brand new Stretford End built in 1994 and north stand in 1996, the stadium may have been of decent quality and sufficient to hold Euro 1996, but capacity of 56,000 was still below actual demand.\nDespite varying height of all stands, Old Trafford's inner edge of the roof has remarkably remained at almost the same level for years. This incline towards the field became a signature feature of the stadium, making the north stand's third tier barely visible to some fans inside as the roof prevents parts of the crowd to see others.\nThe last major expansion so far took place in 2005-06, when two northern corners were filled with brand new facilities. Called the quadrants, brand new towers with 6 floors and tall cantilevered roof structure make for a more unified silhuette, while also expanding floor space and capacity to around 75,000 seats. While not enough to beat the stadium's all-time record, this safely made Manchester United the dominant British team in terms of crowds.\nNicknamed The Theatre of Dreams, the stadium was first called that by Sir Bobby Charlton."

                    "description": "Tottenham Hotspur Stadium - stadium description\nTottenham had played host at the site beside High Road since 1899, when the first iteration of White Hart Lane opened. The stadium, designed in part by the famous Archibald Leitch, saw crowds of over 70,000 at its peak. But the 1990s brought reforms that forced capacity to fall drastically, quite understandable for a stadium sitting on just 2.4 hectares.\nAt the same time Tottenham was looking north in order to secure land adjacent to the stadium and build something bigger. The plan was first announced in 2007, by 2009 planning application for a new 56,000-seat stadium was filed, designed by KSS Group. The stadium would be part of the Northumberland Redevelopment Project, a major revitalisation scheme for the district. The stadium would mostly be built north of White Hart Lane, allowing transition during construction, while it would be completed after WHL is demolished. However, Tottenham didn't even commit to the scheme entirely until their other option of moving to London Stadium failed.\nBut that wasn't the only factor impeding progress. The club faced an uphill struggle with final landowners north of WHL, which only ended in March of 2015, seeing the last company forcibly selling land. That long wait was used to amend plans significantly, with the club appointing Populous as new designers. New brief included capacity of 60,000 and a venue capable of also hosting NFL football.\n\nAs it turned out, that resulted in a playing field unlike anything we've seen. Not only does it retract, it retracts in three pieces and has a second playing field (synthetic, for NFL and concerts) hidden 1.6m below. The field moves in three massive trays, each weighing over 3,000 tons. Because of scarce space, the field doesn't leave the stadium entirely, it hides under the south stand and its front plaza. That's why it had to be divided into long strips: to enable erection of support columns for the stand.\nThe hybrid main field rests in its garage only as long as necessary, returning back within as little as 25 minutes from initiation. Once it travels all the distance, two side segments attach to the central one, creating a seamless field. Eventually this system should support full season of both Premier League and NFL, should London land a franchise. One more stunning feature is the grow light system which relies on six 70-meter trusses hovering above the field without touching it at all.\nThe stadium's outer form stands out from the district's skyline, reaching 48 meters. Eventually the effect should be diminished with high-rise planned beside the ground. Although the 250-meter long venue will still be clearly visible. While not ideally symmetrical, the oval stadium has its axis of symmetry running from the north to the south, only with minor irregularities in facade cladding.\n\nThere are three dominant materials used in the stadium's outer shell, both the facades and roof. First it's metal (4,801 perforated steel-aluminium panels cover the facade, 27,654m2 in total), glass (genereous glazing ensuring sunlight access to vast atria and single 7,000m2 span in the south) and concrete (largely prefab architectural concrete at the basis of the ground). The perforated panels, some of which are tilted from the facade, create a dynamic shape, covering much of the regular glazing. By day the stadium is metallic, neutral. By night it comes alive with dynamic lighting.\n\nFrom the very beginning the seating bowl was announced as very compact, robust. It was even considered a go at Arsenal, whose stadium was criticised for distance between fans and the field. At Tottenham the closes seat is 4.99m away from the field (south stand, grows to 7.97m on other sides). At the steepest point the stands reach 35 degrees, as much as permitted. The vast south stand received the title of England's second largest single tiered end with 17,500 seats, just behind West Ham's east side.\n\nThe seating layout decisively turns all eyes on the south, however it's actually the north stand that is the tallest, reaching 35.5m. However, with other sides being between 33-34m, visually the auditorium seems to reach the same height. Both stands along the sides are divided into four tiers, of which two middle ones are premium seating only, while the bottom tier is partly dedicated to most affluent visitors. In total the stadium offers over 8,000 premium seats and 70 private boxes of different standards.\nEven though the stands may seem symmetrical, each has a different structure underneath. In all cases its primarily based on steel (16,700 tons of structure steel was used) but main columns vary, mainly being Y-shaped. By far the most spectacular columns are the two 'trees' under the south end. Each of the two trees (standing exactly between segments of the resting field) weighs 275 tons and and becomes a major aesthetic element, not just a piece of engineering. But even smaller columns, invisible to fans, can weigh as much as 200 tons each.\nAlong with progress of construction, the amount of steel used was increasing due to replacement of reinforced concrete by steel prefabs in order to speed up the process. But there was one area in which some steel was actually saved. The roof structure was initially planned as regular truss structure, later replaced by tensile cable structure, which reduced the wieght by 600 tons. Similar to that of Volgograd, the new structure consists of 54 upper and 54 lower radial cables measuring approximately 42m and 38m long respectively. Two inner rings of the roof are connected by 'flying columns' that also support floodlighting for the field.\nInstead of traditional membrane, the roof is made up of 287 glass roof sections and 810 roof cassettes consisting of metal and acoustic panels facing the bowl, and a metallic finish polymer membrane facing the sky. The roof has some 30,000 m2 (part of it is bonded glass selected over polycarbonate) and was designed partly with a boost of atmosphere in mind. In the north a row of boxes was installed under the roof, while in the south the roof is topped with a 4.5-meter cockerel sculpture and equipped with a skywalk, letting tourists to look inside the ground from above.\n\n\nThe stadium ended up holding over 62,000 already in its first year, which is almost twice the size of White Hart Lane (36,000). In terms of footprint the stadium also is roughly twice the size of its predecessor (43,000 compared to 24,000 m2). But in terms of floor space it's four times the size, reaching 120,000 m2, spread across 9 levels. It's thus no wonder that over 60 catering points were fitted inside, including the longest bar in Europe (65m) or another bar with its own microbrewery. And that's just a piece of what regular fans have on offer, the hospitality areas are a story of their own...\nConstruction of a stadium that large had to take long, as if the prolonged waiting wasn't enough to test Spurs fans' patience. Enabling works on the northern part were launched back in 2014, sped up in 2015 as the compulsory purchase order for last landowners came. Inauguration was then expected in early fall of 2018, some 3 years of first major works. That deadline was missed a few times, however, seeing opening only in April of 2019. It also didn't go perfectly in terms of budget. Initially expected to cost some £400, the stadium saw final price tag possibly double (reaching some £1 billion with secondary facilities), however Spurs never revealed the detailed price tag for the stadium alone."

Upper tiers of seating were to be recycled.\nRegular construction works started in May 2008, but preparatory works date back to mid-2007. Along with progress of the huge project in Stratford numerous controversies were raised for aesthetic, financial and political reasons. Main structure was ready in 2011, but opening of the venue was delayed until May 2012.\nDuring construction legacy plans were changed with football use being the preferred future and West Ham United the preferred tenant. Despite numerous protests, the selection was sustained and in 2014 reconfiguration began to make the stadium as suitable for football as possible.\nThis includes installation of the world's largest cantilever roof, retractable lower tiers and permanent sanitary/commercial infrastructure around the stands. All of these efforts were chosen to allow maximizing revenue for Premier League fixtures and also host athletics events in the summer."

Initially named Ashburton Grove from the street it was planned along, the venue soon gained a huge sponsor that paid 42 million pounds for a 15-year naming rights deal (later prolonged by 7 years to 2028). The partnership with Emirates Airlines earned the stadium something more than the expected profits. Some fans began to criticise the exposition of the sponsor which started to remind them more of an airport than a stadium of their beloved club. Thus the ironic nickname \"Arsenal Terminal\".\nApart from great profits from sponsorship, Emirates Stadium is also given as an example of matchday revenues. In a very short time it overtook much bigger Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid. High revenues also come at a price though - tickets for Arsenal games are among the most expensive in the world. Still the club has a sell-out crowd at nearly every game and a waiting list for season tickets with thousands of people.\nThe seating bowl has been divided into 4 levels, two of which are dedicated to business clients. This along with restrictive regulations lead to a poor atmosphere, criticised by away fans as well as journalists. As it was with Highbury, the new ground of Arsenal is still compared to \"a library\"."

But since the club could not buy the ground from its owner, they moved to Goodison Park. The move left John Orrell with an empty stadium so he launched Liverpool FC. The club started playing in 1892 and by 1906 already had 2 championships on their account. During that time three new stands were raised.\nIn 1928 history of the world's most famous stand began, as The Kop was expanded to accomodate 30,000 standing fans. For decades this has been the central point for Liverpool FC fanbase. Further redevelopments allowed the club to achieve a record audience of over 61,000 in 1952 and play their first game with floodlights in 1957.\nCrucial changes came in the 90's as a result of Taylor Report, published after Hillsborough disaster. Currently the stadium comemorises 96 victims of that day with an eternal flame. Legendary manager Bill Shankly also has his place at Anfield with a monument and a gate named after him.\nIn 2014-2016 the stadium underwent its largest partial reconstruction to date. The western main stand grew from one to three tiers, dominating the stadium and landscape. Thanks to this change, LFC are able to invite over 50,000 fans for the first time since conversion to all-seating capacity. The club also has outline planning permission for similar expansion to follow along Anfield Road (north end).\nWork began on September 30, 2021 and is expected to be completed before the 2023/2024 season. After the expansion, the capacity of the entire stadium will increase to 61,000 spectators."

As the bid failed, planes were downsized and a much smaller stadium has been built as the main venue of the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Capacity decreased from 80,000 to 35,000, part of which was temporary seating. Total cost stood at 110 mln pounds.\nSoon after the event the first revamp has started. Athletics track and pitch were removed and the ground lowered to create space for additional tier of seating in a football-specific configuration.\nThe temporary stand behind one goal has been dismantled and replaced by a permanent construction identical with one at the other end. This had cost another 30 mln pounds and made the stadium a good home for Manchester City which could then leave their historical home - Maine Road.\nIn 2011 the naming rights for the stadium were obtained by Etihad airlines for 150 million pounds - a record deal in British football at that time.\nIn 2014-2015, for the first time since takeover by Manchester City, the stadium was expanded. The south stand received a large new third tier, increasing overall capacity by over 6,000 seats. Similar expansion is also planned behind the northern goal in the future."

Since 1880 it's been home to football, but only since 1892 also to Newcastle United, who then played in red-white outfits, contrary to current black-white colours. Already in 1905 it had the capacity of 60,000 people, mostly thanks to the stands having standing room. In the next 90 years it has changed several times, achieving an all-seating capacity of 36,610 in 1993.\nIts current, unique shape is the effect of local conditions. The club was seeking permission to build a brand new ground nearby, but that proposition was widely protested by residents. Having no better alternative, „Magpies” decided to redevelop current stands, building an extra tier over two of them and one corner. This made one part of the stadium significantly larger than the rest. Thanks to this asymmetrical expansion it now boasts Europe's largest centilever roof over the higher part of the stands."

Further remodeling was halted due to the outbreak of World War I and complete revamp ended in 1924. Even decades later Villa Park was regarded as one of the greatest venues in England created by the famous Archibald Leitch.\nIn 1939 further works were carried out by Leitch's son who was responsible for the south stand, built in mid-1940. It was soon changed to garrison soldiers during WWII and later bombed by German air force. The damage caused to northern side of the ground wasn't repaired until 1954. Floodlights were installed in 1958 and in 1962-63 roof was added to two of the stands. Most important redevelopment so far came in the 1990's though, after Hillsborough disaster prompted regulation changes. In 1992-94 new south end was erected and later, in 2000-2001, a new west side with 3 tiers.\nApart from Aston Villa games the stadium was host to 1966 World Cup and 30 years later Euro 1996. Starting 1899 England's national team was regularly playing here until 2005 and further games were transferred to new Wembley, thus ending over century of England's game. Other sports also took place here - cycling from the start, rugby since 1909 and boxing from 1942.

It was in 1905 that Chelsea was founded by owners of the venue at that time after Fulham refused to move in. In its initial form the ground had room for some 100,000 people, but only 5,000 under a covered stand designed by renowned Archibald Leitch. Remaining 95,000 has to use uncovered terracing surrounding the athletics track. Interestingly, the main stand was a copy of identical structure erected at nearby Craven Cottage not long before.\nFurther decades brought several changes with one almost leading the club to fold. A new east stand, first one to be built close to the pitch (without athletics track), was opened in 1973. It was supposed to be first of four new ends, but costs grew so much in the course of work that Chelsea lost ownership of part of the freehold. Part of the stadium was then bought by property developers Marler Estates. Only after the company went bankrupt in early 1990's did the ground become Chelsea's property. Or actually property of Chelsea supporters as they were major shareholders in Chelsea Pitch Owners, a trust established to assure stable future for the stadium.\nA fun fact (or so it seems today) is that in 1984/85 season electric fence was built around the pitch to prevent fans from invading it. However do to no approval of local authorities it was never actually turned on. In 1990's remaining parts of the athletics track were removed and changed with new stands - with roof and seats, as the Taylor Report required.\nIt would be quite a challenge to count all events that took place here. Starting from athletics and little known shinty back in 19th Century, through greyhound races, cricket, baseball, American football and last, but most important, obviously - football. Three FA Cup finals were played here (1920-1922), national team also gave 5 appearances (last one in 1946) and Chelsea gives the ground day-to-day use with average attendances not falling below 41,000 even once since the 2003/04 season, meaning sell-out crowds at nearly all home fixtures."

In 1892 a local contractor was ordered to erect three stands - two open terraces and one covered. Complete capacity was 11,000 (two with 4,000, 3,000 under cover). Implementing the plan took less than 6 months and Everton became the first club in England to have a purpose-built football ground (just several days after the world's first - Celtic Park).\nUntil 1895 the Toffees leased the venue and were only then able to buy it, providing redevelopments just several years later. New stands came in 1906 and 1909, both double-deckered. Two more double-tiered ones came in 1926 and 1938, making the ground have two levels on all sides. Three of those stands were designed by famous Archibald Leitch.\nFirst game with floodlighting came in 1957 and since it was a derby clash against Liverpool, over 58,000 people attended it. Just a year later England's first under-soil heating system was installed here with first scoreboard following in 1971. A major challenge came in the ‘post-Hillsborough era' as three ends of the ground had terracing and needed conversion. One stand had just seats installed, another a lower tier redevelopment, while the last - southern, was simply demolished and rebuilt as a single-tiered end in 1994.\nOver the years this ground has seen more top league games than any other with Everton spending just 4 seasons outside domestic top flight. To add to that, only 6 times the club hasn't enjoyed average crowds that would put it in England's top 10. Record average came in 1963 as each game was seen by more than 51,600 people. The stadium also had its share of international fixtures, to start with 1966 World Cup, during which it even hosted a semi-final.  "

They had no alternative venue in Brighton, so were playing 75km away in Gillingham. Though attempts to build a new home stadium started back in the 1990's, no success came for a decade. Supporters were running several large-scale campaigns that even got the prime minister involved, but for years procedural issues and opposition held the project back.\nFinally at the end of 2008 construction works started on site and finished in early June 2011. The result was American Express Stadium, as it's called for sponsorship reasons. But since no-one really cares to say the whole name, it's more often called AmEx Stadium or simply The AmEx. There also are some more traditional supporters who refuse to acknowledge the name, still calling it Falmer Stadium, as was the name during planning and construction.\nbut however they call it, it's still a 22,347-seater worth Ł105mln. The seats were divided into four separate stands. Main one has three tiers and accommodates over half the capacity - 11,833. Opposite is the family stand (5,404) while behind both goals there are ends for the more vocal locals (north - 2,688 seats) and away fans (2,575).\nIf demand is high, corners may be filled and current stands may also receive a second tier to give a capacity of 35,000. Which proved needed as already during construction it turned out that the planned 2,109 business seats was too little and another 400 were made. By mid-2013 stands had to grow further, reaching 30,750."

It was then, in 1744, that the Molineux family bought the plot of land on which they've built Molineux House, later changed into Molineux Hotel. In 1860 another owner came in and made the place a leisure centre, retaining traditional Molineux name, but making it Molineux Grounds. Finally in 1889 local brewery bought the land and leased it to Wolverhampton Wanderers for their permanent stadium. Yet again, Molineux family name prevailed, this time joined by ‘Stadium'.\nFirst game was played already in September 1889 in front of some 4,000 people. In 1923 “Wolves” bought the ground and soon afterwards began to build a new main stand. In1932 another one came, marking a historical moment - for the very first time Molineux had four stands. These were in use for the next 50 years. In 1953 floodlight masts came, replaced by new ones in 1957. Being among the first venues in England with artificial lighting Molineux became host to many prestigious international games.\nNew eastern stand was built in 1979 for a massive sum of Ł10 mln, beyond what others were spending at that time. It could accommodate 9,500 fans and had 42 skyboxes. Ironically, this lead to a decline as “Wolves” were heavily in debt because of their investment, getting close to bankruptcy twice. Understandably all renovations were brought to a stop for several years, resulting in two stands being closed in the 80's. The club was relegated down to 4th tier by that time so crowds were much smaller anyway.\nThe municipality came with a helping hand, buying Molineux in 1986. “Wolves” were bought by a new owner in 1990 and soon afterwards came the largest revamp so far. Starting in October 1991, one stand after another all four were replaced by December 1993. They remained nearly unchanged for two decades. In 2011 the Stan Cullis Stand was torn down to be replaced by a new structure, this time with 2 tiers of seating.\nThe reconstructed stand was put into use in August 2012. Two other stands were to undergo similar modernisation, but the work was never completed. Meanwhile, in 2019, a new, more ambitious plan for further redevelopment has emerged, involving an increase in capacity of the stadium up to 50,000 spectators. However, there are no concrete details as of now."

The city wasn't - it received its charter just a year earlier, which obviously called for a celebration. That is why the ground's name from the beginning was City Ground. And though it did lie within city limits, it wasn't owned by Nottingham.\nMajor revamps came in the 1960's. First in 1965 new main stand was erected, but sadly existed for only 3 years.  On August 24th 1968 a fire broke out at half time of the Forest - Leeds United fixture. Though there were over 30,000 people in attendance, thankfully there were no casualties. The club played 6 rounds at nearby Meadow Lane and, ironically, didn't win even one at the archrivals' turf. In 1967 new east stand was erected and the first game saw the highest attendance to date, with 49,946 watching Forest beat Manchester United.\nOther significant changes came with the new executive stand in 1980 and redevelopment of 1992-93, when the ground was being prepared for Euro 1996. But there were more big events than just this tournament. City Ground also hosted Heineken Cup's semifinal, several FA Cup Finals (female) and concerts. The City Ground was already the seventh venue in Nottingham Forest's history."

Unique in its form and praised for old school ambiance, it survived the era of 'identikit stadia', even though the age has proven problematic over the years.\nWhen admiring it from bird's view, you clearly see the independent stands originating in different times, representing different approach to design and crowd organisation. Altogether - a true British stadium, created over time rather than in one go. It dates back to 1924, when the main stand was built on land bought from local rail company.\nSoon the main stand was aided by terracing on other sides and the stadium bares the accolade of having been initially designed by Archibald Leitch, perhaps British football's most important non-football legend. In 1969 the single-tiered Arthut Wait Stand was added, leading to the crowd of 51,482 people during FC Burnley game, to this date official standing record of the venue.\nThe remaining two stands of today were built in the post-Taylor era, in 1995. Most importantly, the double-tiered Holmesdale Stand, which is home to local ultras. Equipped with a very distinctive, arched roof, it dominates the stadium. Opposite of it is the Whitehorse Land Stand, with just over 2,000 seats and two levels of corporate seating.\nStarting in 1953, the stadium has been equipped with floodlights, too. Historical masts of old can still be admired within the main stand, even if with new lights these days. Most recent wave of changes followed in 2013-14, when the club won promotion to Premier League and speerheaded repairs across Selhurst Park, including seating replacement in some areas.\nThe changes came at a price, which would have been mitigated by a regular naming rights deal, were it not for the resitence of supporters. Eventually a deal was negotiated that formally transferred the rights, but with no actual change. This model was used by Neteller, then JD Sports.\nWith ongoing discussion over its future, Crystal Palace FC introduced the concept of a brand new main stand in 2017. It would see the stadium grow to 34,000 seats and show strong connection to the actual Crystal Palace - iconic pavilion after which the club is named. Should that operation succeed, further interventions would depend on available resources and growing demand."

The name Craven Cottage derives from a residence that - supposedly - hosted a number of majestic guests, including Queen Victoria. The building standing in the place of today's central circle of the pitch was lost in a fire in May 1888. Converting the ruins and surrounding garden into a football field took 2 years. First ever game with admission fees was played in 1896. Ironically, first wooden stand accommodating some 1,000 people was raised short afterwards.\nBut the ‘real deal' came in 20th century when renown architect Archibald Leitch was on the job. In his carrier Leitch designed almost 40 of the most famous British and Irish grounds. Craven Cottage with its red-brick façade of the main stand is among the most precious monuments  of Leitch's work along with the historical Ibrox front wall.\nIn its history the stadium went through quite a few revamps, but among British stadiums, especially in top flight football, Craven Cottage has an opinion of a ‘classic'. Single-tiered stands with flat roof supported on pillars based in the audience are topped with four tall floodlight masts. There's no seating in the corners apart from the clubhouse - literally, a house. Although called simply “The Cottage” it is not to be mistaken with the historical Craven Cottage. This one is the result of an… error. Leitch, although a specialist in stadia, had apparently forgotten about players changing rooms in his initial design. Now it is used as a special suite for corporate clients who wish to watch “The Cottagers” in premium conditions.\nSummer 2019 saw the start of the redevelopment of the west stand, located on the banks of the River Thames (known as the Riverside Stand). The previous structure was replaced by a brand new, much larger, two-storey stand complete with extensive facilities. At the start of the 2022/23 season the lower tier of the new stand was opened, providing over 2,000 additional spectator seats. After its full opening, scheduled for the summer of 2023, the stadium capacity will increase from the previous 25,700 to 29,600 spectators. The new, distinctive stand has changed the look of the entire venue, which combines traditional features with modernity.\nAlthough its history dates back into the 19th century, for Fulham it was already the 9th ground (!), making the London club one of two teams with the highest number of home grounds, losing only to QPR which leads with 14. Apart from Fulham the national teams of Ireland and Australia treated this venue as ‘home away from home', playing their home fixtures there temporarily. In 1948 four games of the Olympics were played here and in 1967 a record hattrick was scored here. Jimmy O'Connor of Ireland needed only 133 seconds to score 3 goals!"

Plans for relocation have surfaced already in 2002 but became substantial after 2012, when the club bought 3.1 ha (7.7 acres) of land on Lionel Road South, just 1.6 km (a mile) east of the historical home.\nInitially the plan was to deliver a football-specific stadium for 20,000 people, with expansion option to reach 25,000. Such version received planning permission in 2013 but its delivery was put on hold as the club opted to build stronger financial backing. A new formula was found that would see over 900 new homes built around the new stadium, across four nearby plots. Because purchasing that land took further time, construction could only begin in 2017.\n\nBecause the stadium plot is triangular, uniquely restricted from all sides by railway lines, incorporating a football ground into it became a challenge. AFL architects decided to position the field along the east-west axis rather than north-south. The stands' shape became irregular, nearly hexagonal, with the main stand in the south, where the biggest amount of space for additional facilities was available.\nDuring design work, the vision was amended several times and the most recent changes, from 2017, saw capacity reduction from 20,000 to 17,250. Instead of double-tiered stands behind each goal, single-level auditorium was to be created, with a modest north side to allow an internal road run along the nearby railway tracks. Reduction in overall capacity didn't impact the projected revenue because premium seating was increased from 1,874 to 2,866, based on thorough market research.\n\nBut the most impressive changes to the design were of structural nature. The 2017 design saw a 50% reduction in reinforced concrete use and roughly 30% reduction of the structural steel consumed, to just 2,600 tons including grandstand prefabs. These changes caused a serious reduction of the stadium's carbon footprint. Combined with rainfall collection and solar power plant (400 m2, 30% of which is used directly for stadium needs) on top of the south stand, the efforts earned the stadium BREEAM certification for sustainability.\nIt also made the stadium futureproof, at least to some extent. In order to meet highest requirements in case of sporting success, the building was always planned with Premier League regulations in mind, including highest standard for disabled supporters. Also, the option of introducing safe standing at the stadium was included, should this become legal. Also, the building meets Premiership rugby requirements because already in 2016 it was decided that a groundshare with London Irish is the most viable option.\nIn order for colours of both teams not to clash, the stadium's identity isn't too packed with Brentford FC symbols, even if their signature red and hexagonal symbols are visible inside and out, referring both to the ‘Bees' and the stadium's hexagonal form. But most of the building is grey, seats have a mosaic colour scheme, while public concourses are equipped with LEDs to change colours depending on the host.\nTotal footprint of the stadium is just 22,000 m2, which is impressive since roughly half is the field. The main stand has 4 floors of facilities inside, while other stands offer a single level of facilities. The building's irregular shape becomes an advantage aesthetically, making it unique and escaping the ‘identikit stadium' stereotype. The angular form is covered with tin, polycarbonate and powder-coated aluminium panels imitating stone, a neutral and modern mixture.\n"

Dean Court lost its form in 2001 however, due to complete revamp. The pitch was rotated 90 degrees and moved slightly to increase distance from local housing. Three new stands were built and the open side on the South was later filled with a temporary stand. In 2005 Bournemouth sold the ground to Structadene developers and leases it since then.\nRecord attendance was set in 1957, when AFC Bournemouth matched Manchester United in the FA Cup. 28,799 people watched that game.

Now this may seem a noble history, but back in the days it was a must, because in 1905 Luton had to move from their previous gorund, which was sold on short notice by the owner. And though Luton Town aim in leaving the ground since 1955, they haven't succeeded so far. They never became any of England's top clubs, but surely they've got their achievements at Kenilsworth Rd, to name just avarage attendance of over 25,000 fans per game at peak.\nBut before crowds began flocking the ground, money had to be invested. In 1921 main stand was consumed by a fire and had to be rebuilt. The structure raised in 1923 stands until now, of course with a few revamps along the way. In 1953 a friendly against Turkish Fenerbahce inaugurated floodlights at the ground and a year after that crowds of over 25,000 were attending nearly every game. Unfortunately in further decades attendance was constantly dropping due to installing seats on all stands. In 1985 it was already an all-seater with just over 10,000 seats, as it is until now.\nAn interesting fact is the membership scheme introduced by the club in 1985. For 5 years authorities were allowing only local people into the ground, causing criticism among away travelling and the FA as well. It even resulted in the club being banned from the League Cup for 4 years until Luton finally dropped the idea."

Their Roker Park was unfeasible for redevelopment along new requirements and not suitable for expansion. In 1992 chance to build a new venue next to Nissan car plant appeared, but was blocked by the manufacturer. Finally in 1995 plans were announced for a stadium on the site of former coal mine, very close to Roker Park.\nInitially it was planned to have 34,000 seats, but was later changed to 40,000 and before opening in 1997 to 42,000. Despite these alterations works were done on schedule. Even more the price sounds very low, at just £16m. Further £7m was spent by the club in 2002 to expand the ground to just below 49,000.\nThe name pays tribute to miners of whom many are still part of Sunderland's fanbase. The light is symbolized by “Davy's lamp”, a traditional element of mining equipment. Monument of the lamp is located next to the stadium. Since 1997 Stadium of Light is constantly used by Sunderland, but has also played host to two national team games and numerous concerts in the summer season."

                    "description": "Elland Road - stadium description\nThe history of the stadium on Elland Road is linked to the nearby pub, The Old Peacock, which stands opposite the south-east corner of the venue. This pub has been in operation since 1826 (the current building was constructed in 1963). In 1878 the new owner of the pub, Bentleys Brewery, levelled the meadow opposite and laid out a playing field, later known as The Old Peacock Ground. The pitch was used privately, by the pub, and was also used by rugby players from Leeds Athletic Rugby Football Club. In 1897 the ground was purchased by Holbeck Rugby Club for the sum of £1100, on the condition that its sporting character was maintained for at least 7 years and that the brewery retained its catering rights.\nHolbeck Rugby Club built a stand adjacent to the pitch, which was ready by the 1898/99 season. The new stadium soon became known as Elland Road (after the street next to it). In the early years, the venue was mainly used for rugby, although it also played host to football matches, including Leeds Woodville in the 1902/03 season. In 1904, Holbeck Rugby Club ceased to exist after losing the play-offs for promotion to the First Division.\nIn August 1904 a meeting was held to discuss the future of the stadium. It was agreed that it would be used for the newly formed Leeds City FC football club. On October 13, 1904, a lease was signed for £75 a year, with an option to buy the facility for £5,000. Just two days after signing the agreement, the club played their first match at the stadium, losing 0:2 in a friendly against Hull City. The club eventually bought the facility for £4500.\nIn 1905, at a cost of £1050, the team built a new main stand on the west side, capable of holding 5,000 spectators. The pitch was turned 90 degrees and the existing main stand, located on the south side along Elland Road, was now behind one of the goals. In 1906 Leeds City FC bought additional land on the north side of the pitch where, at a cost of £3,000, a new stand was built. The wide, terraced stands on the north and east sides gave the stadium quite a high capacity; in 1910 an FA Cup semi-final between Barnsley and Everton was held here, watched by 36,000 spectators.\nDuring the First World War the venue was used as a site for military parades and for shooting practice. After the war, Leeds City were accused of financial irregularities, including paying then illegal wages to footballers, leading to the suspension of the team and its dismantling in 1919. Plans were then put in place to build a brickworks on the site to take advantage of the clay deposits beneath the stadium. However, the site was briefly leased by the Yorkshire Amateur club, which saved the stadium from liquidation. Leeds City FC were soon replaced by Leeds United FC, who became the new hosts of the venue.\nIn the early 1920s, the south stand was upgraded with a new wooden barrel-shaped roof. This became known as the 'Scratching Shed'. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the east stand, known as The Lowfields, was extended and partially roofed. The terraced stand behind the north goal was nicknamed Spion Kop (or Kop), after the hill in South Africa where many British soldiers fell in the battle against the Boers in January 1900. On December 27, 1932, 56,796 spectators attended the match against Arsenal, an attendance record that was not broken for another 35 years.\nIn 1927 two other stadiums were built next to Elland Road. Behind the east stand, a facility was established primarily for motorbike racing, known as Fullerton Park. On the other side of the road, a greyhound stadium was built and remained in use until 1982. A new police station was opened in its place in 2014.\nDuring the Second World War the stadium premises were adapted for use by the military administration. On November 9, 1953, on the occasion of the match against Scottish Hibernian (4:1), floodlights were inaugurated at the stadium. On September 18, 1956, the west stand of the stadium burnt down in a fire, along with offices, locker rooms and floodlight generators. The damages were estimated at £100,000. The club received compensation but this proved insufficient to rebuild the burned stand, but thanks in part to a public collection which raised £60,000, a new west stand was erected for a sum of £180,000 and opened at the start of the following season.\nOn March 15, 1967, the stadium's later unbeaten attendance record was set. The FA Cup match against Sunderland (1:1) was watched from the stands by 57,892 spectators. During the game, one of the barriers in the stand near the south-east corner collapsed, leaving 32 people injured.\nIn April 1968 the terraced north stand (Spion Kop) was demolished and replaced in less than six weeks by a new covered stand known as the Gelderd End. The cost of building the new stand was £250,000. The first rows of the new stand were placed slightly to the north of the previous one, allowing the pitch to be moved more than 9m in that direction, thus enabling a larger south stand to be built in the future. In 1970 the north-west corner was built and shortly afterwards also the north-east corner. In 1971 a grass heating system was installed.\nIn 1974 a completely new south stand was built at a cost of £500,000. The lower stand had 4000 standing places and the upper stand had 3500 seats and boxes. In the same year, a new floodlighting system was commissioned, based on the highest floodlight masts in Europe (79.2 m). At first only three masts were erected, the missing fourth one, in the south-east corner, was added four years later. In 1991, the missing southeast corner was added, completing the stadium structure. In April 1992, a reception area and conference centre were opened at the rear of the west stand.\nIn the summer of 1992, the east stand was demolished. In its place, an even larger two-storey structure with a capacity of 17,000 was built. The stand was fully completed in January 1994 and was the largest cantilevered stand in the world at the time. Its construction cost £5.5 million. The redevelopment also saw the removal of masts in favour of floodlights mounted in the canopy.\nDue to changes in legislation following the Hillsborough tragedy and the publication of the Taylor Report, in 1994 the North Stand saw the last standing seats in the stadium removed, installing nearly 7,000 seats. In the same year the stand was named after Don Revi, a former player and coach of Leeds United and the England national team.\nIn August 2001, club chairman Peter Ridsdale polled shareholders and season ticket holders on whether they favoured further expansion at Elland Road or a completely new stadium in the south-eastern suburb of Leeds. The vast majority of respondents (87.6%) were in favour of building a new facility. However, the club ran into financial problems in the early 2000s and the planned construction of a 50,000-seater venue, like several earlier plans to redevelop Elland Road, failed to materialise.\nIn 2004, following the death of former club player John Charles, the west stand of the stadium was named after him. The south stand was upgraded in 2006 and the east stand in 2011. In 2009, a LED display was also installed in the south-west corner. In April 2020, the South Stand was named after Norman Hunter, the former Leeds United player who was in England's 1966 World Cup winning team (although he did not play a single game at the tournament). In November of the same year, the East Stand was also given a patron. The patron was Jack Charlton, long-serving Leeds United player and 1966 World Cup champion, brother of the famous Bobby Charlton.\nIn its early days (from the construction of the first stand in 1898 until 1904), the stadium was used primarily for rugby, and was hosted by Holbeck Rugby Club. In 1904 the role of host was taken over by the newly formed Leeds City FC football club. Following the club's demise in 1919, it was succeeded by Leeds United FC, who still play at Elland Road today. Between 1983 and 1995 the venue was co-hosted by rugby league team, Hunslet RLFC. The venue has also temporarily served a number of other teams, such as Huddersfield Town playing at Elland Road in 1950 after their own stadium caught fire, and Bradford City in 1985, also after their own arena caught fire.\nThe Leeds United footballers playing at the stadium won the English Championship three times (1969, 1974, 1992), they were also runners-up five times (1965, 1966, 1970, 1971, 1972). The best period in the club's history was in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as in the 1990s and early 2000s. The team also won the FA Cup (1972), EFL Cup (1968) and the FA Community Shield (1969, 1992). The squad also recorded outstanding performances in European cups, winning the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup twice (1968, 1971), as well as reaching the finals of Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1967), Cup Winners' Cup (1973) and European Cup (1975).\nIn 1996 the venue was one of the venues for the European Football Championship played in England. The tournament saw three group stage matches take place at Elland Road (all involving Spain). The England national team also made occasional appearances at the stadium. In 2015, two Rugby Union World Cup group stage matches were played at the venue. In autumn 2022, the stadium will also be one of the arenas for the Rugby League World Cup. Elland Road hosted the final matches of the Tri-Nations rugby league tournament in 2004 and 2005, and its successor the Four Nations in 2009 and 2011.\nThe stadium was touted as one of the venues for the Olympic football tournament following Manchester bid to host the 2000 Summer Olympics (eventually hosted by Sydney, Australia), as well as one of the venues for the 2018 World Cup as part of England's bid (but Russia was chosen).\nElland Road has played host to many other interesting events, for example, on July 28, 1985, it played host to a match between England and Germany featuring the players who appeared in the 1966 World Cup final (the game was played as part of a charity fundraiser for Bradford City after their stadium caught fire, and ended with a score of 6:4). On May 19, 2018 the stadium hosted an IBF featherweight world championship boxing fight (Lee Selby vs Josh Warrington, won on points by Leeds native Josh Warrington). The stadium has also hosted American football and Gaelic football competitions. It also hosts non-sporting events including concerts (Queen, U2 and Rod Steward have all performed there).\nThe stadium has a football-specific, rectangular layout. The stands surround the pitch on all sides and are made up of two tiers. The dominant main stand on the eastern side is clearly higher than the others, with the height of its lower tier corresponding roughly with that of the other stands. With its built-up, rounded corners, the structure is a compact, enclosed architectural mass, although the stands on the north, west and south sides differ in their detailing. In the south-west corner there are only seats in the lower part, while the upper part contains a LED screen.\nThe stands are fully roofed and can hold 37,608 spectators. Each of the four stands has its own patron, these are: Jack Charlton (east stand), Don Revie (north stand), John Charles (west stand) and Norman Hunter (south stand). The seats in the stands are coloured blue (except in the south east corner where they are yellow). The floodlights are located in the canopy. The facility is equipped, among other things, with a heated pitch.\nThe stadium has two statues of former Leeds United players, Billy Bremner (at the south-east corner, unveiled in 1999) and Don Revi (opposite the east stand, unveiled in 2012). The stadium is located in the Beeston area, approximately 2 miles (3 km) south of Leeds city centre."

                    "description": "Hillsborough - stadium description\nIn spring 1898 it was still a meadow with a dandelion flowerbed. A year later, out of necessity, it became home to Sheffield Wednesday. They had to move from the former Olive Grove which was used for railway expansion. However, part of the ground prevailed in new location as a 3,000-people stand was transported to Hillsborough estate in Owlerton (thus the club's nickname “The Owls”), outside city limits. Until 1914 the ground bared the second name, but was later changed to Hillsborough.\nThis name today is commonly associated with the place of one of football's largest disasters, but the ground's history is much richer. However, not only positive. As it was first revamped in 1914, a wall fell on spectators, injuring 75 people. Later it was only better with Hillsborough growing rapidly and becoming one of England's largest and most important venues. It played host to 27 FC Cup semifinals as neutral venue and several national finals in both the FA and League Cup. But most importantly it became a magnet to fans nationwide. To make the scale of changes visible, let's just say that in 1898 it could accommodate some 5,000 people. Less than 2 decades later, in 1914, it was already 43,000. And another 2 decades later, in 1934, the record crowd of over 72,000 was seen.\nNo wonder that as one of the most important stadiums it was included both in the 1966 World Cup and Euro 1996. Unfortunately it's not the sporting events, but tragedy of April 15th 1989 that brought the ground to the spotlight. Due to very poor policing and crowd management on the day of yet another FA Cup semifinal 96 Liverpool supporters lost their lives. Though police tried to put the blame on supporters/hooligans, official inquiry has indicated it was in fact the police who were responsible and no hooligan incidents took place.\nThese events left the ground empty and closed for safety improvements, of which installing seating and gates opening towards the pitch for evacuation were the most important ones. Similar changes were implemented across the country and later worldwide, making this venue one of the most important ones in the history of football stadia. First major tournament after the disaster was Euro 1996 which was not called off in Sheffield. Ironically, to this day the ground does not fulfill all the recommendations of Taylor Report published after Hillsborough disaster. One of these being that all seats should be covered, while there is one section without any roof over it - though opened only for largest away groups, when regular sections are not enough.\nThough the stadium has not changed significantly since the 90's, it's still very popular among fans of Wednesday who provide large following of not less than 20,000 people per game - impressive if we take into account that the club is struggling to get back in the top two divisions. And though it's been years since the golden era for this stadium, it's still the largest venue outside of the Premier League."

The document outlined measures to be implemented, primarily installation of individual seats, which prompted mass conversions and expansions to meet ticket demand. With the redevelopment of century-old Ayresome Park considered unviable, Middlesbrough FC decided to relocate to a new ground.\nMiddlesbrough FC spent almost all of the 20th century at Ayresome Park, built back in mid-1903. The ground stood roughly 2.4 km (1.5 miles) south-west of the Riverside, in a housing area. This meant it wasn't possible to expand sufficiently in the post-Taylor era, beyond its closing capacity of 26,667 people. Once the club stopped using it even for training purposes, Ayresome Park was demolished in 1997 and replaced by housing.\nGeographically closer to the city's centre, the new stadium was located in an industrial area, within the largely vacant Tees docks. The deteriorated site was offered by the Teesside Development Corporation and approved by the local council. Construction began in fall of 1994 and took impressively little time, less than 9 months. Opening game against Chelsea drew over 28,000 people, which was already the highest turnout in 14 years. Demand proved high enough to prompt expansion just 3 years into the stadium's existence. Addition of corner sections brought the capacity up to roughly 35,000.\nWhile the land and necessary approvals required cooperation from both public and private entities, the stadium is owned privately by Middlesbrough FC, who also financed construction of Riverside Stadium. However, the project - being the largest new stadium opened in England post WWII - also utilised public funding for anciliary infrastructure, primarily the road network.\nAlthough the first expansion took place just 3 years after opening, in 1998, corner stands offered the same standard as the initial construction. It wasn't until 2016's return to Premier League that the stadium proved somewhat aged, following over 20 years in operation.\nThe stadium received a brand new LED floodlighting system, a new press section with improved working area for journalists, as well as wheelchair platforms to match growing push for accessibility of English stadia. The hospitality facilities were also upgraded, while the south stand received two new TV studios.\nThe north stand, along the Teesside, is referred to by fans as the New Holgate End, in honour of the famous terrace at Ayresome Park, where generations of supporters used to stand. The west side is by far the largest in terms of volume, not only comprising bulk of matchday facilities but also offering two tiers of seating rather than one.\nRiverside Stadium hasn't only been home to Middlesbrough FC games but also internationals. During reconstruction of Wembley, for example, the national team played here against Slovakia before Euro 2004, setting the stadium's attendance record."

But before decision to relocate from The Dell was made, the old ground was converted into all-seating mode. Only then, in late 1990's it came out that the city can offer a deteriorated plot in the centre to Southampton FC. It was in a great location, just neighbouring the place of club's birth. No wonder it was named St. Mary's Stadium as it was located close to the St. Mary's church where “Saints” came from.\nConstruction works lasted from December 1999 to July 2001 and cost some Ł32 mln. The outcome are single-tiered stands encircling the pitch with accommodation for 32,689 fans. If needed, the construction can handle another tier with seating up to 50,000, but that would require dismantling the roof. It's interesting feature is having parts transparent over two stands to provide proper lighting to the pitch. Club earns from 42 skyboxes and 4 large halls, each named after a legendary player of “The Saints”."

The stadium, despite historical upgrades and quick renovation proved too modest for increasing interest in City games.\nConstruction of a new venue became the most likely option in mid-1990s, even 40,000 seats were mentioned initially. But in November 2002 the club presented its vision to move just meters south of the old stadium, to a single-tiered 32,000-seater.\nWork started in the summer of 2001 and the stadium was operable already within one year, in time for the 2002/03 season.\nUnfortunately, the move came in a difficult moment - sponsorship and transfer markets collapsed, while City weren't only relegated from the Premier League, but also had to bear the cost of £37 million new stadium.\nClub went into receivership and lost control of its new stadium, taken over by Teachers Insurance. The American company sold it in 2013 to King Power, Thai corporation who previously bought the club as well.\nDue to naming rights deal, the stadium had been called Walkers Stadium from 2002 to 2012, later becoming known as King Power Stadium, promoting the Asian investors. However, for many fans it's still Filbert Way, for its address and connection to the historical roots."

As the venue is based on a prefab steel frame, it only took several months to erect it.\nConstruction had cost £14.7 million with funding coming from the club, city of Stoke-on-Trent and the Football Trust. Mixed ownership with both SCFC and municipal authorities changed in 2007, when the club bought all shares of other holders, becoming sole owner.\nOpening was done by Sir Stanley Matthews, club's biggest legend. He also received a monument next to the stadium that shows him in various stages of his career. When Matthews died in 2000, his ashes were buried under the central point of the pitch.\nIn 2012 Stoke City announced plans to build a new section in south-eastern corner, originally room for giant screen. This move is expected to raise capacity above the 30,000 mark."

In 1906 four stands were erected in the Bordesley district, one of which was covered and equipped with benches, remaining ones terracing. It could accommodate over 60,000 people and record attendance was set in 1939 FA Cup game against Everton.\nSoon the venue suffered damage during WWII German bombings and a fire that took place in similar time. In 1950's several renovations took place with floodlights being set in 1956, giant screen mounted in following years, just like roof over The Kop. A new main grandstand was also built.\nFollowing decades brought little changes though, which caused the standard to fall dramatically. In 1980's only two thirds of the light bulbs were working and construction was very week. Critical moment came on May 11th 1985, when riot caused a wall to fall, killing a boy. Soon a huge shift took place nationwide after disasters prompting regulation changes and the stadium had to be rebuilt. This however could not happen until 1993 when the club, then in administration, was bought by new owners. From 1993 to 1999 three stands were built from scratch and the only remaining one, the main grandstand, had a facelift."

Its standard wasn't the highest as well, biggest proof of which was collapse of parts of the pitch by up to 9 meters into the ground due to chalk shift collapse underneath. Attempts to level the field failed, FA refused to accept the ground any more.\"The Canaries\" were then forced to find a new ground fast. They bought a plot encircled by Carrow Road from three sides and have been there ever since. Building the new stadium had to be extremely fast and was indeed - tenders took no more than 11 days and the whole construction process of stands accommodating around 38,000 people was just 82 days! No wonder the club called their new ground as 'the 8th wonder of the world'. Soon after opening an extraordinary guest appeared in the crowd. In 1938 king George VI watched Norwich fight Millwall as the first monarch to ever attend a 2nd league encounter.In 1956 floodlight masts were raised, nearly running the club bankrupt. But sporting success grought money and in the next 5 years three stands were covered, leaving only one without roof. Then came years of raising the standards. First after the Ibrox Tragedy of 1971, then after fire consumed one stand of Carrow Road in 1984 and finally after Hillsborough, which forced the shitft towards all-seating stadia. Along with redevelopments one corner was then filled with a hotel."

First revamp came in 1928 with a new covered terrace being added at the south-eastern side. 30 more years passed before another big change - erection of a new main stand with press and executive seats. Then in 1970 another one was mounted on the opposite side of the pitch. Last new section came in 1994, when uncovered terraces behind one goal were replaced with a new seated stand. Also around that time came other changes forced by the Taylor Report.\nGlory years have already passed at Ashton Gate. Bristol City could not dream of a crowd similar to the record attendance from 1930's, so no wonder plans for relocation were put in place along with England's efforts to host the 2018 World Cup. Eventually they fell through, forcing City to consider expansion of Ashton Gate.\nThe venue is also important for British rugby - since 1920 it's used regularly by Bristol Rugby club and is also the place where largest rugby crowd in Britain outside Twickenham was seen.   \nIn 2014-2016 the above-mentioned expansion of Ashton Gate finally came to fruition, becoming the single most expensive (and extensive) operation to ever be carried out at the stadium. Massive new main grandstand and south end were both built, while the east stand was improved, altogether giving the stadium a new, modern look and prolonging its lifespan by no less than 2-3 decades."

However, insufficient funding initially blocked the development.\nThorough analysis of several plots in the city and outside Hull ended with West Park being selected. The place is both near city centre and in a fair distance from homes, not deteriorating residents' comfort on matchdays.\nPlanning and design were done by Arup Sport and Miller Partnership - both companies renowned for their other English stadium work. Single-tiered bowl (topped by a second tier only on the west side) were to accommodate between 25 and 30,000 people. Though capacity was finally left at 25,000, possibility to expand by adding another tier to the east still remains. 28 skyboxes are included in capacity, all located between tiers of the main stand.\nStadium is owned by the municipality as it provided £42 out of £44 million. This was possible when Hull sold their shares in Kingston Communications, stadium name sponsor. Despite some difficulties along the way, construction ended within expected budget and schedule (14 months).\nSelected colours have a meaning - seats in black-white-amber are to fit two tenant clubs: Hull City (black-amber) and rugby team Hull FC (black-white). Meanwhile external towers in blue-gold colours resemble Hull's municipal crest.\nBoth football and rugby sides provide week-to-week use for the ground nowadays, though City are said to be analyzing a possible move due to inability to buy the stadium from the municipality. National teams in both disciplines also play some fixtures here, though the stadium isn't of major importance nationwide. Summer concerts bring stars every year, with the likes of Elton John, Bon Jovi or R.E.M. playing."

In fact, each stand is different. West and north ones have two tiers (with 26 and 16 skyboxes, respectively), with western one also being the tallest stand. It has temporary lower tier seating, allowing for concert stages to be set up. East and south sides are single-tiered, backed on the land slope. South one is the one away followings are allocated at.\nUpon completion it was thought to be among the most innovative stadiums in England, receiving RIBA Building of the Year in 1995.

Soon afterwards the very first stand was created in the west, initially with tent serving as changing rooms for players.  \nAttendances growing beyond the 10,000-mark forced the stadium's expansion both in the west and north in 1920s, while new Town End, built in 1928, was consumed by fire after just 5 years. That's why the new east side, Pavilion Stand, opened in 1934 and standing until early twenty-first century allowed larger crowds to gather.\nRecord games for Preston North End were seen in 1930s, with the Arsenal classic in 1938 being watched by over 42,000 people. However, in the case of Deepdale, it wasn't always the men on top (so to speak) - ladies' football proved very more popular here and the Dick, Kerr's Ladies FC is said to have drawn crowds of over 50,000 for their games, though their record 53,000 was set in Goodison Park.\nAfter the tragedies of late 1980s, decision was made to redevelop the stadium. Inspired by Italy's Stadio Luigi Ferraris, works started in 1994 and saw the new west stand open in 1995, north end in 1997 and south end in 2001. Only the east side remained untouched until 2006, when it was closed for redevelopment and reopened in 2008, setting capacity at 23,404.\nIn 2001-2010 the National Football Museum was housed at Deepdale, home stadium of one of the Football League's founder clubs. The museum was later relocated to Manchester. "

The new ground built in early 90's was a proof that the team put safety at games first. It was the first venue built along with and after the introduction of lord Taylor's guidelines after the Hillsborough disaster. And although the opinion of Millwall is still rough, it's more about stereotypes.\nBefore 1993 the club resided some 500 meters away, at Cold Blow Lane. Previous ground was also called The Den. That's why for first years of the new one's existence fans simply called it “The New Den”  to make a distinction between the two. Old Den could be filled with nearly 50,000 fans, but only one out of ten had a seat. Millwall decided converting the terraces into seating wasn't viable and decided to build from scratch in the vicinity.\nToday's Den accommodates almost 20,000 with average attendances slightly above half of the ground. Initial plan was to raise a stadium for up to 30,000 people, but insufficient funding made the club go with a less ambitious plan. The venue has good rail connection, but there is no open parking around it, making it hardly accessible by car on matchdays."

Three years was the ground left unused until Argyle club became host to sporting events - initially in athletics, but soon football became the most important discipline. Back then the ground consisted of one wooden grandstand for some 2,000 people and tailings on remaining three sides.\nFirst major revamp came in 1920 when the club advanced to Premier League and main stand was replaced by a covered concrete structure. So were the remaining sections, however they were transformed into uncovered terracing. New infrastructure for players and officials was also created, largely funded by supporters association. Following years saw the club draw large crowds with average around 20,000 in 1930's and record attendance reached in 1936's game against Aston Villa.\nWWII bombings that hit Plymouth in 1941 due to its military base status haven't spared the stadium. Main stand was almost destroyed and repaired after the conflict ended in 1945. It was later replaced by a two-tiered stand by Archibald Leitch (1952, along with floodlights), one of his last works. Until mid-80's remaining stands were receiving cover.\nPlans to build a completely new venue were drawn in 2001 with three stands being replaced that same year as part of first phase. Main grandstand was supposed to be next, but it hasn't happened to date. In 2011 the club went into administration and municipality took over the ground."

And not without a reason - the ground stands where a foundry responsible for iconic NY City hydrants used to be. But more simply new stadium is just called after the neighbourhood it was built in.\nAlthough construction took just over one year, plans were in place much earlier. Rotherham United didn't come to an agreement with their previous ground's owner and had to seek for an alternative. Temporary stay at the Don Valley Stadium was no solution in the long term, so the idea of new community stadium was brought forward. Design drawn in 2010, plot bought the same year, construction started in June 2011. By mid-July 2012 the stadium was ready for opening.\nIt took £25 million to build the 12,000-seat stands that encircle the pitch, but it's not just that. New York Stadium is also the biggest conference centre locally with capacity of up to 700 people for single events. It's also located very comfortably within walking distance from the centre, close to railway station and bus interchange, also with decent car capacity.\nThe visual side was done by S+P Architects. Along with their vision the bowl grows proportionally from south-east to north-west, ending with the dominating main grandstand. The seating is all in one tier, apart of course from the skyboxes and suites.  "

Capacity of the Baseball Ground was decreased from over 40,000 to just 17,500 seats for safety reasons and that wasn't close to satisfying Derby County's aspirations. That's why on February 21st 1996 fans were informed that from the 1997/98 season on they will be watching “The Rams” at a new ground, located on the outskirts of Derby, in the newly created Pride Park business park.\nDesign was ready almost from the start as it's basically the one of Middlesbrough's Riverside Stadium that opened its doors in 1995. Architects of Miller Partnership have implemented over 30 alterations, but still similarities are visible just too well. It's easier to name the differences, most distinctive of which are the roof line, north-western corner filled with corporate space rather than regular seating and main stand's façade.\nConstruction was started with piling in September 1996, then followed by massive concrete- and steel -prefab mounting. Fans were able to see it thanks to a purpose-built visitors' centre that took on some 75,000 guests while in operation. After a rough winter there were delays in construction, but the fast pace allowed for workers to catch up and follow the deadlines. They had a unique motivation as this ground was the first ever to be opened by Queen Elizabeth II herself."

Some fans questioned its location outside Bolton (previous Burnden Park was within walking distance for many) and some had trouble accepting Reebok as name holder.\nBut since Reebok is a long time sponsor of Wanderers and in fact a local company, the name became less of a problem over the years, with most fans referring to the stadium as simply ‘The Reebok'. As for the Burnden Park sentiments, club's previous ground was honoured with one of streets surrounding Reebok Stadium called Burnden Way.\nThe venue was designed by Populous (then HOK Sport) and has a very distinctive appearance with steel trusses dominating local skyline, with roof supports and floodlight pylons integrated with one another.\nInterestingly, the seating capacity of over 28,000 could have been higher, but corner sections of the upper tiers were never approved due to poor evacuation routes, thus seats weren't installed there.\nApart from Wanderers holding their fixtures, the stadium also hosts rugby matches and quite some concerts, compared to other league grounds. The non-sporting function of Reebok Stadium is supported by a hotel integrated into the south stand, with some rooms overlooking the pitch."

The Valley's story is somewhat unique because it was built largely by the supporters in a former chalk pit.\nFor economic reasons it had no seats or even terracing to begin with, fans were occupying the embankments, shape of which earned the ground its name. Being based on landfill the stadium was cheap to expand, growing to roughly 75,000 at peak, even if heavily underfunded due to the club's sporting misfortune.\nDespite great bond with the site, fans had to part with the Valley in 1985, following Chalrton's bankruptcy, loss of ownership of the ground and heroic efforts by fans to rebuild the club. The Addicks relocated to Selhurst Park (1985-1991) and Upton Park (1991-1992) to finally get back home in 1992.\nTo make it possible, fans first had to prove themselves once again by running their own political party and lobby for redevelopment of the ground in the Greenwich Council. With ‘The Valley Party' winning 11% of the vote they created a noticeable force and won approval for public support. Again, largely with volunteer work by supporters, the Valley was made usable again in 1992.\nCurrent shape of the stadium is the outcome of 1994-2002 redevelopments. Only the south end remembers 1980s. Single-level east stand was opened in 1994, the double-tiered west side in 1998 and north end with adjacent corner sections in 2002. Charlton had the ambition of expanding the stadium further, up to 40,000, but had to hold the plans after relegation to second and third league.  "

The main administration building has a mock Tudor appearance and was accompanied by another building with a clock tower. These however have been dismantled with only the small cottage-alike part left to this day.\nThanks to its fame and standard it was home to its first (and, as it later turned out, only) England international game already in 1903. Several decades later the 1948 Olympic tournament was co-hosted by Fratton Park which was one of only two outside-of-London stadiums to be chosen. In 1956 it was the first Football League ground with floodlights (Feb 22nd, against Newcastle United).\nBut, just so that it doesn't sound all too modern, in 2007 it was the last venue in the Premier League to have an uncovered stand. It wasn't until 2019 that the building's iconic floodlight masts disappeared, with new lighting being installed within the roof.\nToday's stadium consists of four independent stands, without any filling sections in the corners. Two parts along the sides are double-tiered while those behind goals have just one tier. Due to low capacity and poor infrastructure the club was seeking options to upgrade the ground or move to a new one, but so far - without success."

However reality proved these plans were too ambitious for a third-league side. That didn't stop Port Vale overall, just forced a decrease in plans.\nNew stadium had to get built as the club lost tenancy at its previous ground. Decision was made to build in a former clay pit next to Burslem Park where Vale started their history.\nConstruction took long 5 years and resulted in 40,000 capacity (though only 360 seated)Stands were erected alongside the pitch, while end zones were land slopes. Before first decade of existence ended, size went up to 50,000 people (in 1954, 1,000 seated) and floodlights were installed (1958).\nIn mid-1980s problem appeared as capacity fell to just over 16,000 for safety reasons. Late 1980s saw hundreds of thousands spent on floodlight improvements, scoreboard and spectator facilities, like first of its kind in the UK disabled section. But these efforts didn't solve size problems, inspectors again cut capacity, to 12,000.\nNo wonder intensive works started in early 1990s to convert the ground into an all-seater and last game with terraces took place in late 1998. Right after this construction of a new eastern stand began. Interestingly, it hasn't been finished to date."

When Peterborough United were moving in around 1934, a new building with dressing rooms was added in the background of the stand. It lasted until major revamps came in 1950's.\nIn 1942 United were close to losing their tenancy as they owed money, but two individuals came in and saved the day by paying off the debt. Soon afterwards new terracing was built behind goals. A decade later the club was stable enough to buy the ground back and redevelop it. Goal stands received cover in 1953, with a new main stand built in the north in 1957. Interestingly, it was built behind the previous one, not in its place. After completion the older stand was dismantled and pitch was moved closer to the new one. After this 4th stand was erected opposite the main one with inauguration of floodlight masts in 1960 ending a very dynamic decade.\nMain stand was revamped in 1992 after the Taylor Report. Then in Spring of 1996 the newest addition of that time came - a 2-tiered stand with skyboxes in the southern part of the ground, opposite the main stand. After this major change fans had to wait until November 2014 to see the new eastern grandstand with some 2,500 seats."

For centuries it was mostly used by pigs until football settled in between late 19th and early 20th century. Initially it was home to Exeter United, renamed Exeter City in 1904, remaining on the site to this day.\nAt that point the stadium had one grandstand in the west and terracing/embankments on remaining sides. By 1921 City had the resources to buy the ground, though they had a rough start. After just 5 years significant part of the grandstand burnt down in a large fire, forcing players to change clothes in nearby pub. It took months to repair all of the damage.\nWhen rebuilt, the stadium saw its record crowd in 1931, when Sunderland came and defeated the hosts in front of nearly 21,000 people.\nLike many stadiums across England, this one also underwent the most significant changes following the Hillsborough Disaster. However, in Exter's case it was significantly more painful as the club went into administration in 1994 and had to sell the ground. It then went into the hands of private developers and was bought back by the city council to safeguard the club's existence.\nOnly then reconstruction of the Big Bank terrace (north) and Cowshed (east) took place, seeing both rebuilt with cantilevered roof and significantly standing out when compared to the 1926 old Grandstand. Still, the southern away terrace remains the worst part of the ground despite plans of upgrades."

In 1970 floodlights were first lit and the club played Chelsea to celebrate it, drawing largest ever crowd of 14,000.\nIn 1990s United had a chance to win Premier League promotion spot, but instead went down by four tiers, thus losing any hope for stadium improvement. Officials refused to installed the recommended plastic seats all around the ground, arguing they would only do that when advancing to a league requiring such facilities.\nIn 2004 further financial trouble caused the club to sell Abbey Stadium to a private entity. Despite attempts by fans to buy it back, the ground still doesn't formally belong to United."

As second phase a modern east stand (with 7 skyboxes, among other features) was opened, but not in 2010, as initially planned, but in 2011."

In 1907 executives decided that having a privately-owned stadium may bring profits and a year later first stands were raised. Until 1920 it could already take up to 20,000 people just to be used for cattle, horse and sheep grazing a year later, because of World War I.\nIn its history it went through 7 significant revamps. Their effect is an 82,000-capacity venue with fans on three tiers of covered seating. Thus, from 2006, Twickenham is the 2nd largest stadium in England and 4th in Europe for any football code. When it comes to rugby - there's no match. After the 2006 redevelopment it comprises the English rugby headquarters, a museum and a 4-star hotel.\nRuled by the rugby union from the start, it's got a huge history behind it with almost all England international played here and many other of the largest rugby games also being hosted by the London venue. There's also a story for the fan-culture enthusiasts. Ever since an amazing England-Ireland game in 1988, the song “Swing Low, Sweet Charriot” became almost an alternative anthem for rugby fans. Of course there've also been a lot of other events organized here with a whole list of top music performers . However, due to logistics (location and capacity constraints for concerts - only around 55,000 people allowed) it never became as successful as Wembley in bringing various events."

The club remain the only permanent users, though England U21 and rugby side Saracens from London play some of their games here.\nStands are able to accommodate 32,000 people, but for the first 5 years only lower tier of 22,000 was open for the public, with seat installation at the upper one planned for 2013. If demand ever reaches such level, there is also room under the roof for a third tier to increase capacity to 45,000.\nOfficial name has always been about ‘Stadium mk', but had various configurations (with cursive, bold or other visual effects). Locally it's also known as Denbigh Stadium for its location in Denbigh, southern district of Milton Keynes."

The venue was then taken over by two businessmen, Philip Scott and Graham Sizer.\nSince the opening capacity was restricted to 10,000 by local authorities who found local road infrastructure insufficient to cope with larger crowds. However, if hosting events with greater demand, organizers can apply for one-time permissions to open more parts of the stadium."

The club was a secondary tenant and had to accept priority of cricket fixtures at its first stadium, then on the other side of Trent river. Pushed by the FA club decided to build its own ground in 1910, which was done hastily with one stand literally transported over the river.\nFirst game of Sept 1910 was the local derby against Forest. The Nottingham clubs are since then the closest derby rivals in England with not even 300 meters between their grounds. The first Meadow Lane derby was attended by 27,000 people which may be seen as ironic. After over 100 years the stadium doesn't offer that many seats.\nUntil 1923 the ground hasn't changed. Erection of a new stand was the only major revamp to happen for the next two decades. Heavy bombings during WWII forced another changed in 1942. Main stand was replaced in 1970's and the next decade proved to be depressing for the club with the ground deteriorating. That state had to change after the Bradford and Hillsborough disasters that prompted infrastructure improvements countrywide. Three new stands were erected with only one remaining much unchanged."

On a daily basis the hosts are Birchfield Harriers, one of England's most historic athletic clubs.\nWhen it opened in 1976, the venue had only one stand, on the west side. In subsequent years, it was also joined by two arches - the south-west and the north-west. In 2012, the east stand was completed.\nIn connection with the organisation of the 2022 Commonwealth Games, the existing east stand and the arches were demolished in autumn 2019. Then, between 2020 and 2022, completely new stands were built on the arches and the east side. After the expansion, the capacity of the stadium was set at 18,000 spectators, with the possibility of additional temporary auditoriums being added for large events."

Vast majority of the industrial complex (190,000 m2) was demolished in 2009 to make way for a stadium of 18,000 and a large Tesco supermarket.\nBoth buildings were built at the same time, though the store was delivered a month earlier, in October of 2011. First official game took place early into 2012 as anchor tenants St. Helens RFC took over. While primarily a rugby ground, it's also used as the home of Liverpool FC reserves.\nBuilt on the east-west axis, the stadium has its main stand along the south side, which is where all crucial media, sporting, office and commercial facilities are based. The grandstand is decorated with bright red cladding, matching club colours and creating a more vivid identity to the otherwise simple structure.\nOnly the stands along both sides are equipped with seating, because in the UK rugby games are permitted with standing room, prohibited at football. This is also part of the reason why record attendance is slightly above nominal capacity.\nAt the time of opening it was named Langtree Park, promoting the main contractor in a 5-year deal. In late 2016 a new contract was secured and in turn it secured the stadium headlines throughout the world of sport as the new name became Totally Wicked Stadium, this time advertising an e-cigarette brand for further 5 years."

The time matters as just one week before that Portsmouth have become the very first club to play a league fixture with artificial lighting.

Since 2007 the stadium worth Ł32 mln (public spending) is used by three clubs: the Doncaster Rovers, rugby side Doncaster RFLC and female team Belles LFC. From time to time it changes into concert venue for music stars on national tours."

But it wasn't called that since the beginning. In early years, since 1896, it was called Athletic Ground. Make no mistake, though, Oldham Athletic didn't exist back then, the ground was used by Oldham County. This changed in 1904 when tenants changed and the venue had its first revamp.\nThere is another name, one used more as an anecdote - Ice Station Zebra. Thanks to its location high above sea level (at 155m asl - one of highest stadiums in England) it was exposed to cold winds and thus regarded as one of the coldest stadia in the country. Zebra part refers to the club playing in black-white stripes.\nIn the first decades it was very big with crowds in excess of 40,000 possible. Capacity reached its lowest point in 2008, when one of the long end stands was demolished to make way for a new structure. The new stand in its place was built in 2014-20.\nThe oldest stand, the main one, still has some elements of the initial stadium of the early 20th Century.  However, all sections are nowadays seated, as Athletic were playing in the Premier League in the early years after Hillsborough, when seating was made mandatory.\nInterestingly, Oldham laid artificial pitch already in 1986, long before it became a recognized solution. This brought accusation that good results are based on pitch advantage. But those results led the club to Premier League in 1991 and forced Oldham to lay a natural turf, as synthetic ones aren't accepted in top tier football in England."

Fact is that until 1947 the venue was called Priestfield Road, only then changing Road for Stadium. But let's start from the beginning…\nThe club - initially known as Brompton FC - bought a plot for their first ground back in 1893 and opened it in September of that year. With one stand for 500 people and hundreds of others flocking to the slopes and fences around the pitch. First expansion took place in 1899, then in 1908 and 1913 (first covered stand) came further works that increased capacity by - as it was popular back then - terraces mostly. What was also popular was sheep grazing during the week and non-sporting events like smoking concerts having their time as well.\nWith these steps “Gills” reached 20,000 by 1940's and had their record audience of over 23,000 during a game against QPR in 1948. Then came the largest one-phase redevelopment that saw pitch leveled (wasn't really horizontal before that) and two more stands built. No big capacity increase, though. Until 1980's it was around 22,000 people with other improvements having priority, like floodlight masts (1963).\nAfter safety revolution inside British stadia further works had to come and between 1997 and 2004 all stands were replaced. However last one, behind one of the goals, was changed for a temporary structure as the club decided to seek a site to relocate to. To date there is no decision on that issue and so the temporary stand still exists."

This was due to stricter safety regulations implemented after Hillsborough disaster. Meanwhile most of the ground's 9,400 spots were standing, thus needed to be closed or changed into much more space-consuming seating. After a period of reduced capacity the stadium was enlarged to 11,300 in 2003.\nThere are two large banqueting/conference rooms and three bars at the ground. It is known for rather unsympathetic exterior. One façade, the most seen one, is located adjacent to M6 motorway and covered in advertising, which only adds to the cheap cladding."

                    "description": "Edgeley Park - stadium description\nEdgeley Park was originally built for the rugby league team, Stockport RFC, who leased the ground owned by the Sykes family in 1891. The first rugby match was played here on September 3, 1891, with the initial construction of a small covered main stand on the north side and terraced stands on the east and south sides.\nIn 1902 Stockport County FC became co-hosts of the stadium and played their first game here on September 13, 1902 (a 1-1 draw with Gainsborough Trinity FC). The rugby league team was soon disbanded and Stockport County remained the only club playing at Edgeley Park, where it still plays today. In subsequent years the stands around the pitch were gradually extended.\nIn 1935 the wooden main stand on the northside burnt down, and with it the club's archives. A new stand was built in its place a year later. On October 16, 1956, the first match under floodlights was played at the stadium (Stockport County FC - Fortuna '54 Geleen 3:0). In 1977, the venue hosted Queen Elizabeth II. This was one of the highlights of the Silver Jubilee celebrations to mark the 25th anniversary of her reign.\nOn March 30, 1946, a return match of one of the Football League Third Division North Cup rounds between Stockport County FC and Doncaster Rovers FC was played at the stadium. After a 2-2 draw in the first meeting, the same result followed at Edgeley Park as well. The rules at the time did not yet allow for a penalty shoot-out, and extra-time was played until either team scored a goal.\nThis time, however, no goal was scored in extra time (the hosts did score one, but the referee blew his whistle), and the match ended due to the descending darkness, after 203 minutes of play. In the end, a coin was tossed to determine the host of the next rematch (played at Doncaster, where the local team eventually won 4-0). The match of March 30, 1946, held at Edgeley Park, is the longest known football encounter ever played for stakes.\nOn February 11, 1950, an FA Cup match against Liverpool FC (1:2) set a stadium attendance record (the fixture was watched from the stands by 27,833 spectators). On January 14, 1958, England's national team played two unofficial friendly matches at Edgeley Park, against Manchester City XI and England Under-23 national team. In July 1978, the venue hosted the 3rd edition of the World Lacrosse Championships.\nAlongside Stockport County FC, the stadium also played host to union rugby team Sale Sharks, a Premiership Rugby participant, between 2003 and 2012. During their time playing at Edgeley Park, the team won the national title once (2006) and triumphed once in the European Challenge Cup (2005), Europe's number two rugby union competition.\nThe stadium is located in the Edgeley area, close to Stockport town centre. The stadium pitch is surrounded on four sides by stands, with a total capacity of 10,842 spectators. The stands are equipped with plastic seats, predominantly in blue. Supporters of the visiting teams are seated in the stand behind the eastern goal, which is the only one not covered. The eastern stand features a LED screen. Four floodlight masts stand in the corners of the venue.\nThe main stand on the north side was built in 1936, following a devastating fire to the previous wooden structure in 1935, and has been named the \"Danny Bergara Stand\" since 2012, in honour of the former Stockport County FC manager. The south stand, which has been rebuilt several times, has been named the 'Together family Stand' since 2020, due to a sponsorship deal (it was previously known as the 'Popular Side', 'Vernon Side' or 'Barlow Stand').\nThe concrete terraces on the east side (known as the 'Railway End') were built after redevelopment in the 1980s. In 2001 the stand, the last in the stadium, was fitted with plastic seating. This part of the auditorium accommodates supporters of the visiting teams and, as of 2019, there is a LED screen, which replaced the former digital scoreboard. It is the only stand in the ground without a canopy. Due to an agreement with a sponsor, it has been renamed the Vitality Railway End Stand for the 2022/23 season.\nThe stand behind the west goal, known as the 'Cheadle End', is by far the tallest one in the stadium and its capacity is almost half that of the whole ground. It was completed in 1995 and a friendly match against Manchester City was played on its opening day (July 31). It replaced a wooden stand, which was decided to be demolished after a disastrous fire at Bradford Stadium in 1985 (thereafter, only low concrete terracing stood behind the west goal until the new stand was built).\nThe architectural concept for the Edgeley Park expansion can be seen on a separate subpage\nStockport County FC were promoted to the National League in 2019 and EFL League Two in 2022, returning to the fourth tier of competition in England after an 11-year hiatus. The successes have reignited the ambitions of the club's officials, who hope to reach the Championship (second tier) within a few seasons. Hand in hand with further promotions is also the expansion of the stadium. There are plans to expand the stands on the south side and behind the east goal, as well as to widen the main (north) stand. As a result of the modernisation, the capacity of the venue is to increase to around 18,300 spectators. The work is to be carried out in stages."

                    "description": "Plough Lane - stadium description\nThis stadium's origin might be the most famous among so called ‘phoenix club' stories. When Wimbledon FC relocated to Milton Keynes in 2003, supporters decided to stay put and rebuild their own club. Preserving identity was their short-term goal, while in the long term the dream was to return to Plough Lane, where the team's historical stadium used to stand.\nThe old Plough Lane was in operation since 1912 but fell short of new safety and spectator comfort requirements after the Taylor Report. Since it was beyond saving, Wimbledon moved out in 1991, sharing Selhurst Park with Crystal Palace. The ground remained in limited use until 1998 and was eventually demolished in 2002. With residential buildings covering its area, it wasn't an option to build on the very same spot, however land nearby became available.\nIn 2013, just over a decade since creation, AFC Wimbledon were able to announce partnership with developer Galliard Homes to take over land on which an old greyhound racing stadium was situated, just 200 metres east from the old ground, also on Plough Lane. For the developer such endeavour had to include vast residential development, which meant over 600 new apartments around the proposed new stadium, all packed on just 5.1 hectares.\nAfter turbulent preparation and proceedings, planning permission was granted in 2017 and construction was due to begin in 2018. But, while the site was cleared entirely in that year and the residential part began growing, Wimbledon only took control of their site in December and actual work on the new stadium was launched in first half of 2019.\nFunding for the sports development also proved problematic, despite a significant chunk being covered from the residential part and sale of Kingsmeadow. Supporters came to their club's aid on more than one occasion, first through crowdfunding and then by buying bonds. In total, direct fan payments covered well over £7 million out of a total that ballooned to 33 million. Local businessman Nick Robertson also came to the club's aid without sacrificing its democratic principles.\nAfter over a year of construction, in autumn of 2020, opening became a possibility. But, because of the ongoing pandemic, fans were unable to attend the first match on November 3. The very first opportunity, albeit with restricted capacity, came on May 18, 2021, when 2,000 people enjoyed a friendly against Liverpool FC's U23 team.\nThe delivered stadium is only the first phase of the final build. The west stand with its south-west corner are permanent, while three remaining stands and two floodlight masts are semi-permanent. They can (and eventually will) be dismantled to make way for much larger permanent structures. Such mode was chosen for economic and practical reasons. It's simply much easier to grow within a smaller yet complete stadium.\nThe west side may have a single tier of seating, but together with two glazed levels above it comprises a total of 4 floors of facilities. This allowed AFC Wimbledon to deliver all necessary functions within the first phase, including sporting, administrative, media and hospitality areas. The remaining modular stands are lower but also fully functional. The south end is for the most vocal fans, with its safe standing section, the north end for away followers.\nIn its final layout, the stadium is expected to safely host up to 20,000 people with a compact bowl almost reaching the nearby residential building. Once delivered, it will make it impossible for neighbours to watch games from home."

Its name is owed to a large mill which used to stand just south of the field until its demolition in 1925.\nFor the first half a century it served primarily for cricket and football players were not even allowed to the dressing rooms. This began shifting as the 20th century came along with shift towards football-only use. Although there were episodes of rugby or greyhound racing, the stadium's main purpose hasn't changed since. Even its first concert as late as 2010 has proven the single only one to date.\nFirst grandstand was built along the west side in 1922, while remaining stands were raised with coal ash brought from nearby mines. In 1929 a modest roof/shed was erected in the east, but a much more symbolic event happened the following year.\nOn February 22, 1930 the stadium became England's first to host a competetive game under floodlights. And even though such practices were then sceapped for two decades, the event enjoyed nationwide interest, with representatives of major teams and even Wembley in attendance.\nIn 1957 the supporters club funded a new north end, later adding an even greater effort in early 1960s, when fans bought a stand from the defunct Hurst Park racecourse. Both of these survived until late 1990s, when post-Taylor reconstruction began.\nDuring the 1999-2001 period the stadium changed its image entirely. Three new stands were built, two behind goals and the most impressive, double-tiered one along the west side."

Since United aren't playing above third tier in league system, they're allowed to have a portion of terracing inside the stadium.\nDespite announcements from 2006, the ground hasn't been redeveloped yet.

However, there's still a lot of history behind it. Central part of the single-tiered main stand actually dates back to 1901 and stands unchanged, earning the nickname of oldest stand in the football league. Another interesting story led to raising the Pontoon Stand, behind one of the goals. It was built with supporters' money and still today gathers the most vibrant ones, who unlike many others in Britain use a drum.\nToday's Blundell Park is a real mix. There are four stands, but only two of them connected with a corner section. That is the main stand and the Osmond Stand. But none of those covers the whole length or width of the pitch, both reaching some 75% of their side of the pitch. Opposite the main stand is the Findus Stand that is only some 50 meters wide, but then again is the only 2-tiered stand, thus having a big impact on capacity. That leaves only the fan-raised Pontoon Stand spanning all the way from one corner to another…\nBack in the 80's the ground could cope with crowds up to 27,000, but then came the standing-ban and a massive reduction. Further decrease in seat number was brought hen Grimsby Town got relegated to 5th division, making temporary stands (those were sued to fill existing gaps between existing stands) unnecessary any more. Still - nearly 10,000 for a team playing in the 5th tier? Quite a number."

Construction on the entire plot began in 2011, but the stadium itself needed less time and began growing in mid-2013.\nDespite its oval shape, all stands are separate.

In 1904 the football side Ellacombe moved in. It later merged with United to form Torquay Town, which then merged with Babbacombe in 1921 and reverted to the name Torquay United, becoming the owner and sole tenant of the stadium.\nFirst structures on site were mostly wooden and not too strong, which was proven in 1930, when roof of the main stand was blown off. In the following years not much has changed, but popularity of the club managed to outgrow the stadium, seeing a record crowd of over 21,000 in 1955 FA Cup campaign. The same year Plainmoor became one of the first stadiums in lower leagues to get floodlights.\nCurrent stadium is the outcome of 1990s reforms. New northern stand (seated) and revamped west and south stands were built (both terraced). In 2012 the largest one to date was opened in the east."

Initially it was supposed to become the home of Wealdstone FC, but the club's commercial partners went into liquidation, stopping the development.\nEntire site was made available in a tender in 2006 and Barnet FC took over in an attempt to leave their dated Underhill Stadium. The club succeeded and opened the entire complex in 2013.\nThe stadium has seated grandstands on both sides of the pitch, mostly covered, while both ends are occupied with terracing. The eastern side is conjoined with a vast pavilion, which comprises a fitness and medical centre. Together with 8 full-sized pitched, the site is one of London's best football complexes.\nIn 2016, within just 6 weeks, the stadium was expanded by new north stand, covered and seated. With 1,900 capacity it's now the away section. Another similar stand is expected to be build in the south, this time with a large mixed-use pavilion behind it."

With Redbridge Forest FC sharing the ground and eventually merging with Dagenham, there was enough funding to further renovate the stadium.\nMore changes came in 2001 with a brand new seated south stand (and new floodlight masts), while the tallest western stand was erected in 2009.\nOver the years Dagenham managed to reach a record crowd of 7,200 in 1967. After the merger with Redbridge Forest FC similar crowds weren't possible, mostly due to all-seater rule being introduced. In its current configuration the stadium has a record attendance of 5,949."

While that hasn't changed at all, the stadium is completely different than in the early days. First of all, it's now known as Haig Avenue, while until 1921 it was Ash Lane. As is tradition in England, the stadium's name was derived from its address and also changed along with it.\nMore importantly, the stadium's structure are nothing like they used to be. The old wooden main grandstand (north) burnt down completely after Boxing Day game of 1966, leaving only the safe with matchday proceeds untouched. It was then replaced in 1968 with the current covered grandstand. Another significant change came with the demolition of the southern terrace (for security reasons), which at its peak could hold up to 10,000 people.\nWith limited remaining demand, the stadium now has only low-scale terracing on three sides and the main grandstand. It still plays a significant role, though. It's been used by Liverpool FC and Everton reserves. It also gained its first ever naming rights deal in 2012, then prolonged in 2016."

Since 1989 the stadium also offers floodlighting, though only for match purposes, not enough for TV broadcast.\nIn late 2016 preparations for complete reconstruction began.

Then the club went bust spectacularly and was reborn in 1968, acquiring the current stadium in northern Accrington.\nIts original name is Crown Ground and no, it's got nothing to do with the British Crown directly. It's owed to the Crown Pub, also owned by Accrington Stanley. Formal names over the years have changed a lot, in this century beginning with Interlink Express and Fraser Eagle as sponsors, then moving to Wham, the current one.\nOpened with very modest stands of just three rows on three sides of the field (only the south side had two larger terraces), the stadium continues to be among the smallish stadia to host the Football League.\nThe two southern stands exist independently to this day, even though they're covered by a shared roof. You can notice that they're not parallel, even if well conjoined during post-1990's reforms. Officially they're named Jack Barrett Memorial Stand (east) and John Smiths Stand (west).\nThe west end, commonly known as Clayton End, is occupied by the Stanley Ultras, most vocal fans. It's the most recently covered stand, also equipped with seats in lower rows as an attempt to meet League Two criteria.\nOpposite end of the stadium is taken by the Coppice End, the only entirely uncovered terrace. It's also the tallest stand by row count, usually entirely dedicated to away supporters. However, partly due to weather, travelling fans are also welcome in part of the southern main grandstand.\nFinally, north side is taken by the last stand to have only three rows. The Whinney Hill Terrace is the smallest one, especially after addition of seats and simple roof."

No wonder it was well enough to play home games at the modest Lawn ground in Nailsworth until the 21st century. Situation changed in 2006, when construction of the New Lawn ended just 200 meters west, allowing for the old ground to be used for residential development.\nThe new stadium offers four grandstands, one per side, having part of the terracing inherited from its predecessor. The eastern main grandstand offers significant floor space, used not only for club offices and player facilities, but also banqueting hall for 200 people and a fitness centre. It also has majority of the stadium's 2,000 seats.\nWith total capacity of over 5,000 the club are yet to reach sell-out crowd, though it should be kept in mind that it wasn't until 2016 that they were even close to reaching the English 4th league.\nAfter the club was taken over by Dale Vince (renewable energy giant, owner of Ecotricity) in 2010, the stadium went green much further than the name may have suggested. Local menu lost all meals including red meat first, then became the first vegan one. The field is now considered fully organic, only being fertilized with cow manure. To quote the groundsman, it results in a “lively smell”, but a beautiful turf.\nThe field is mowed without human involvement, by an automatic, solar-powered mower. Forest Green Rovers overall use 10% of solar power to secure their demand, as much as the south stand's power plant produces. Rainwater is also harvested for reuse.\nEventually the club wants to move to a new location, near the M5 motorway junction in Stonehouse. The idea is to build a massive Eco Park there, with stadium for up to 10,000 people and extensive training/leisure complex for £100 million."

The club was anchor tenant until 2002, when AFC Wimbledon came and took over. The side resurrected by supporters also used the supporters determination and financial effort to become primary tenants.\nAs the team moved in, supporters renamed the ground to ”The Fans' Stadium”. At the moment of their move-in, The Dons were beginning their long way back to glory from the 9th league. But the rapid climb upwards forced renovations soon. In 2005/06 the west “Tempest End” stand was covered, while in 2008/09 the main stand was expanded. Finally, in 2012 a brand new east end was established, leaving only the south side very much as it was in the opening days of the stadium.\nEventually Wimbledon are planning to relocate to Plough Lane, where their old stadium used to be. Though it was demolished a long time ago, major redevelopment of the area allows for a new one to be set there. For this very reason Wimbledon agreed to sell Kingsmeadow to Chelsea FC, who aim to make it the home of their women's team."

Local club has been constantly using the site since 1905. Initially as Northfleet United, then Gravesend & Northfleet FC and now Ebbsfleet United, the side had a different ground only in its earliest days, back in the 19th century. Temporary hosts that played at least one season here include Dartford FC, Gillingham FC and Charlton Athletic reserves.\nEbbsfleet United became recognized worldwide in 2007 as the first ever football club to be managed by online users. This brought a publicity boost and initially helped gather funds, but in 2013 the team went back to traditional managing and ownership system.\nOn the western side of the stadium is the new (completed in 2017) stand. Opposite it is also a covered, though much older, structure. The south end is also covered and has been seated since 2006. It's mostly occupied by local fans, while away teams are usually allocated in the north, where the only open terrace stands.\nBefore the great reform of the 1990s the stadium was able to hold over 10,000 people. All-time high came in 1963, when the local side fought Sunderland in the FA Cup. Official number for the game is over 12,000. Since the conversion to seats, the largest recorded crowd is 4,068 at the Canvey Island game in 2002.\nSince 2009, the club had been seeking permission to redevelop the stadium. The original concept was rejected by the local authorities, but in 2015 the club, with a modified design, managed to gain the support of the local government and a new west stand was built between 2016 and 2017."

The reason is purely social: Broadhurst Park was built by supporters and is co-owned by them.\nOf course fans building it isn't literal, although many of them volunteered for some tasks and did fittings and furnishings. The project was initiated and mainly funded by FC United of Manchester, the “rebel” fan-owned club, whose numerous shareholders also contributed personally to raising the necessary funds.\nInitially planned to cost £4.5 million, the building later went up by a million and eventually is estimated to had cost £6.3 million. Largest contribution came from FC United, though several donations/grants were required in order to make the dream real.\nConstruction began in Nov 2013 on the site of Moston football fields in north-eastern Manchester. The sports complex was established back in 1927 and enabled by Sir Broadhurst, whose name it now bears. At the beginning Broadhurst Park was thought to take 40 weeks to deliver, but after issues with the playing field and subcontractors it wasn't ready until May 2015.\nFirst test game took place on May 16 and positive evaluation made it possible to host Portuguese giants Benfica on May 29. That day was the 47th anniversary of the 1968 European Cup final, which also saw Manchester United face Benfica.\nThe building was erected along the east-west axis with main grandstand being built in the south. Conjoined by roof with the significant eastern terrace these two sections may easily be connected by a corner section, left for further development. West and north sides are occupied by modest “sheds”, which allows people to stand behind the field protected from rain. These sections too are possible to expand.\nAside from FC United of Manchester, the stadium also hosts Moston Juniors, a local football team."

Curzon Ashton may have been founded back in 1963, but playing in the Greater Manchester area means stiff competition even at non-league level.\nTheir stadium is even younger, having been opened in 2005, but it already saw some of the world's best players play here. Already on opening night the home side faced Manchester United. It may have been only the reserve side, but it was led by Sir Alex Ferguson. The two sides have been clashing more frequently later, which means that the likes of Pique and Pogba were guests at Timeside Stadium.\nThe ground was built as a community stadium, largely thanks to the Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council, thus the TMBC letters spelt out with seats in the main stand. With just over 500 covered seats, the south stand houses almost all facilities and lies directly next to the venue's 3G training field. The north side has a covered terrace for roughly 1,000 people, while all remaining parts of the field are surrounded by small terraces to give the total capacity of 4,000."

Or, for that matter, its football use goes that far, other sports (most notably cricket) were reported to be held here since 1730!\nDue to the club's unique character the stadium is known for its friendly and hospitable atmosphere. Lewes are a fan-owned club and they gained worldwide recognition for creative matchday posters.\nBut the stadium has even more to offer in terms of charm. The brick-wooden Clubhouse has been on the maps since the eighteenth century, when the stadium was nothing but excavated whole with grassy slopes around. This shape earned it the name of The Dripping Pan.\nToday's stands are located to the west (Philcox Terrace, built as a covered addition to the Clubhouse in 2003), south (Rookery Stand, built in 2007 and only seated and covered section of the ground) and east (Ham Lane End, open terrace used mostly by away teams). There isn't a stand to the north, but the club allows people to take the flat room above the slope."

This also meant that capacity of the team's heyday would not be available anymore.\nDue to naming rights partnerships, the satadium's name has been changing in recent years between Reynolds Stadium, Autoworld Arena and DCJ Insurance Group Stadium.

In its place, the Olympic Legacy Park (the name refers to the 2012 London Olympics) was created.\nA new football and rugby pitch, fitted with third generation artificial turf, became part of the park. The ground, commissioned in April 2017, was built on the exact site of the former Don Valley Stadium, although it is rotated 90 degrees from the previous one.\nIn March 2018, rugby league club Sheffield Eagles moved into the facility, having been forced to play their matches at various stadiums outside the city following the closure of Don Valley Stadium. A modest, although covered, temporary stand was also built adjacent to the pitch.\nIt was assumed that the ground would also be used on a permanent basis by Sheffield United WFC women's football team. The squad moved into the facility at the end of 2018, but decided to move to Technique Stadium in Chesterfield after a year. However, the facility is open to partnerships with other clubs and is also available for hire to ordinary residents.\nIn 2018, renderings of the new permanent stand were unveiled, along with extensive facilities. A modest groundbreaking ceremony was held in January 2020, but work did not start until early 2021. The design of the new stand was carried out by Whittam Cox Architects in collaboration with Arup Sheffield. GMI Construction Group became the main contractor.\nFans had the opportunity to enter the new stand for the first time on May 15, 2022, on the occasion of a charity football match (Sheffield Legends - Hallam FC Veterans 5:0). The first Sheffield Eagles match after the new stand was made available to fans was on May 23, 2022, with the completion of the construction work announced at the end of June 2022.\nOn the west side of the venue, known as the Community Stadium, is the new stand, which opened in 2022. It has 758 covered spectator seats. The three-story building also offers 23,000 square feet of usable space (facilities, offices, meeting rooms, etc.). There are plans to extend the stands to accommodate 3,900 spectators (the stadium's capacity has so far been set at 1,320, including the space around the pitch)."

While cricket is played here to this day (thus the extended field), Sandygate Road is considered the oldest functioning football stadium, as confirmed by Guinness Book of Records. First ever official game was recorded here on Boxing Day (Dec 26) 1860.\nThat fixture was a derby game between hosts Hallam FC and the oldest existing football club, Sheffield FC. For that reason many consider their friendly rivalry the oldest continuing derby. Because of games being played along “Sheffield rules” in early years, it's called the Rules Derby.\nIts rich history adds to the charm of this non-league venue. Charm even greater when you realize that the field at Sandygate isn't level. The south side is located lower, meaning that each team plays “uphill” for 45 minutes.\nCurrent shape of Sandygate is the outcome of renovations and expansions in 1990s. In 1992 the floodlights were added, while in 1999 the covered grandstand for 250 people opened. Behind it new player facilities were created, while old locker rooms were converted to a clubhouse."
